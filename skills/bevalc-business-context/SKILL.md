# BevAlc Business Context Skill

## Overview
This skill provides Claude with comprehensive knowledge about the beverage alcohol industry, TTB regulations, and the BevAlc Intelligence business model. Use this context when writing content, analyzing data, or answering questions about the industry.

## TTB (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau)

### What is TTB?
The TTB is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that regulates the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms industries. For beverage alcohol, TTB:
- Approves labels before products can be sold
- Collects excise taxes
- Ensures compliance with labeling laws
- Maintains the COLA (Certificate of Label Approval) database

### What is a COLA?
A Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) is the federal approval required before any wine, distilled spirits, or malt beverage can be sold in the United States. Key facts:
- Required for all beverage alcohol with 7%+ ABV
- Also required for wine (any ABV) and malt beverages
- Must be approved BEFORE product enters market
- Contains: brand name, class/type, origin, alcohol content, health warnings

### COLA Lifecycle
1. **Application** - Producer submits label for review
2. **Review** - TTB examines for compliance
3. **Approval/Rejection** - Average 10-14 days for approval
4. **Public Database** - Approved COLAs added to searchable database
5. **Revisions** - May require new COLA for label changes

### Why COLAs Matter for Business Intelligence
- **First-mover insight**: COLAs filed 1-6 months before product launch
- **Competitive intelligence**: See what competitors are planning
- **M&A signals**: Filing patterns reveal acquisitions
- **Trend identification**: Category growth visible before sales data
- **Portfolio analysis**: Complete brand inventory for any company
