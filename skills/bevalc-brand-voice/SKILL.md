## Tone by Content Type

### Weekly Newsletter
**Tone:** Professional but warm, informative but engaging

```
GOOD: "Tequila filings jumped 18% this week, with Diageo
leading the surge. Here's what the data tells us."

BAD: "WOW! Tequila is EXPLODING! Everyone's filing and
it's absolutely incredible to see!"
```

### Company Spotlight
**Tone:** Analytical, thorough, neutral

```
GOOD: "Diageo's Q4 filings reveal a shift toward premium
whiskey extensions, with 23% of new labels in the
'Reserve' or 'Special Edition' naming category."

BAD: "Diageo is crushing it! Their amazing premium strategy
is clearly working and they're dominating the competition."
```

### Trend Report
**Tone:** Educational, data-forward, insightful

```
GOOD: "RTD cocktails have grown from 3% of total filings
in 2020 to 12% in 2025. This five-year shift reflects
changing consumer preferences toward convenience."

are where it's at and smart companies are jumping on board."
```

```

The coffee was gone. Hope was fading. Then someone
said 'Peacock.'"

this stuff?? So funny!"
```

```

this week. M&A activity? New market entrants?
We're watching. 🥃"

BAD: "NEW TEQUILA ALERT!!! 🚨🚨🚨 OMG check out what's
happening in TTB filings!!!"
```

## Writing Formulas

### Data Headline Formula
`[Number/Trend] + [Subject] + [Implication/Question]`

Examples:
- "127 New Brands: What's Driving January's Filing Surge?"
- "Tequila Overtakes Vodka in Q4 Filings"
- "3 First-Time Filers to Watch This Week"

### Insight Formula
`[Data Point] → [Context] → [Implication]`

Example:
"Diageo filed 45 new whiskey labels this quarter (data point),
up 30% from Q3 (context). This aligns with their announced
premium whiskey strategy and may signal new product launches
in the coming months (implication)."

### Trend Formula
`[Trend Statement] + [Supporting Data] + [Industry Context]`

Example:
"RTD cocktails continue their rapid growth (trend).
Filings are up 34% year-over-year, with 892 new labels approved
in Q4 alone (data). This reflects broader consumer demand for
convenience and portability in alcoholic beverages (context)."

## Formatting Standards

### Headlines
- Title case
- 60 characters or less for SEO
- Lead with insight, not just data
- Include category or company when relevant

### Paragraphs
- 2-3 sentences max
- One idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks liberally

### Data Presentation
- Round to meaningful precision (3,245 not 3,245.67)
- Use percentage changes with direction (+12% or -8%)
- Compare to relevant baseline (last week, last quarter, YoY)
- Include absolute numbers for context

### Links
- Link company names to `/company/[slug]`
- Link brand names to `/brand/[slug]`
- Link categories to `/category/[category]/[year]`
- Use descriptive link text, not "click here"
