# Enrich Brands Command

Automatically find and save websites for new brands from the weekly sync.

## When to Run

**Friday morning before 2pm ET** - after Thursday 10pm weekly sync, before Friday 2pm email.

## What Gets Enriched

Only **NEW_COMPANY** and **NEW_BRAND** signals (not NEW_SKU or REFILE):
- NEW_COMPANY: ~5-15 per week (highest priority)
- NEW_BRAND: ~150-200 per week
- Total: ~160-215 items, takes 60-90 minutes

NEW_SKU records inherit their brand's existing website automatically.

## Workflow

1. **Read the enrichment list**
   ```
   Read logs/needs_enrichment.json
   ```
   This was generated by Thursday's weekly sync. Shows brands sorted by priority (NEW_COMPANY first).

2. **For each brand:**
   - Search: `"{brand_name}" "{company_name}" {class_type_code} official website`
   - Skip retailers (drizly, totalwine, amazon, wine-searcher, vivino, etc.)
   - Pick the best official website result

3. **Save to D1:**
   ```bash
   cd worker && npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="INSERT OR REPLACE INTO brand_websites (brand_name, website_url, confidence, verified_at) VALUES ('BRAND', 'https://...', 'High', datetime('now'))"
   ```

4. **Report progress:**
   ```
   [1/184] BRAND NAME -> website.com (NEW_COMPANY)
   [2/184] ANOTHER BRAND -> anothersite.com (NEW_BRAND)
   [3/184] OBSCURE BRAND -> N/A (not found)
   ```

5. **Save progress regularly** to `logs/enrichment_progress.json` in case of interruption.

## Multi-Company Brands

If the same brand is filed by multiple companies:
1. Note this in output
2. Use `company_websites` table instead of `brand_websites`
3. Each company gets their own website entry

## Completion

After enrichment:
- Brands with websites show clickable link in modal
- Brands without show "Data enrichment in progress"
- Friday 2pm email sends automatically with available data

## Quick Start

Just say: "Run /enrich-brands" or "enrich the new brands"

Claude will:
1. Read the enrichment list
2. Search for each brand's website
3. Save to D1 in batches
4. Report progress as it goes
