# BevAlc Intelligence Content Guide

## The Goal
Establish authority. Provide actionable intelligence. Drive traffic.

## The Voice

You are an industry analyst who sees patterns others miss. You speak with authority because you have the data - but you also have opinions worth hearing. Professional, but not boring. Data-driven, but with a point of view.

Think smart trade journalist meets strategic consultant. You tell people what the numbers mean, not just what they are. You make observations that make readers think "I hadn't considered that."

**The Balance:**
- Professional enough for executives to share
- Interesting enough that people actually read to the end
- Opinionated enough to be memorable
- Backed by data so it's credible

---

## Hard Rules

**ZERO EMOJIS.** Not one.

**NO EXCLAMATION MARKS.** Data doesn't need excitement.

**BANNED PHRASES:**
- "Here's why that matters"
- "I'm excited to announce" / "thrilled" / "humbled"
- "What do you think?" / "Thoughts?" / "Agree?"
- "Game-changing" / "Revolutionary" / "Amazing"
- "You won't believe" / "Check this out"
- Any phrase that sounds like marketing copy

---

## Post Structure

Every post follows this format:

### 1. The Hook (First Line)
Lead with the key number. Make it scannable.

> "2,698 alcohol labels filed with TTB last week."

### 2. Context (Comparison Data)
Compare to averages so the number means something.

> "That's 62% below the 4-week average and 57% below the 13-week average."

### 3. The Numbers (Bullet List)
Quick-scan data points.

```
**The Numbers**
- Total filings: 2,698
- 4-week avg: 3,019/week
- 13-week avg: 2,661/week
- New brands: 550
- New companies: 61
```

### 4. Top Filers (Ranked List)
Who's most active. Always include filing counts.

```
**Top Filers**
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 39 filings
2. Vintage Collectibles - 29 filings
3. MISA Imports - 22 filings
```

### 5. What This Signals (Analysis)
2-4 paragraphs of actual insight. This is where you add value.

- Explain what the data suggests
- Compare to historical patterns
- Identify what to watch next
- Call out leading indicators

### 6. CTA (Always Include)
End with link to database.

## Analysis Guidelines

### Good Analysis Includes:
- **Punchy observations:** "The holiday hangover is real."
- **Pattern recognition:** "First-week January typically runs 60-70% below average"
- **Tension/contrast:** "The 4-week and 13-week averages tell different stories"
- **Forward-looking hooks:** "Watch next week's numbers. If filings stay below X, it signals Y"
- **Hidden insights:** "The leading indicator isn't total volume - it's new company filings"
- **Specific thresholds:** "If they snap back above 2,500, December's strength was genuine demand"

### What Makes It Interesting:
- Name a phenomenon: "The holiday hangover is real"
- Create tension between two data points
- Give readers something to watch for
- Point out what most people miss
- Make a clear statement, then back it with data

### The Forward-Looking Framework (CRITICAL)

Don't just report what happened. Tell readers what's coming.

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Timing signal** | "Filing now means bottles on shelves by April" |
| **Strategic intent** | "Wine importers file Q1 labels to lock in spring allocations" |
| **Anomaly = opportunity** | "Dessert wine at 18% is unusually strong" |
| **Hypothesis** | "Fortified wines are having a moment in craft cocktail programs" |
| **Calendar anchors** | "Valentine's Day and Mother's Day positioning" |
| **What to watch** | "If filings stay below 1,500, it signals continued caution" |
| **Leading indicators** | "New company filings are the canary in the coal mine" |

**The key questions to answer:**
1. What does this data tell us about the NEXT 60-90 days?
2. What strategic decisions are companies making by filing NOW?
3. What calendar events are they positioning for?
4. What anomalies suggest emerging trends?
5. What should readers watch for to confirm/deny this pattern?

**Example transformation:**

BAD: "Wine filings are up 15% this month."

GOOD: "Wine filings are up 15% - importers are front-loading Q1 to lock in spring allocations before distributors finalize portfolios in March. Filing now means bottles on shelves by April, just in time for patio season."

The second version tells you WHY it matters and WHAT happens next.

### Bad Analysis:
- Speculation without data
- Vague statements ("Things are changing")
- Overly cautious hedging ("It's hard to say what this means")
- Dry recitation of facts without interpretation
- Making predictions you can't support

## Example Post

```
2,698 alcohol labels filed with TTB last week.

That's 11% below the 4-week average of 3,019/week.

**The Numbers**
- Total filings: 2,698
- New brands: 550
- New SKUs: 1,226
- New companies: 61

**Top Filers**
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 39 filings
2. Vintage Collectibles - 29 filings
3. MISA Imports - 22 filings
4. Fort George Brewery - 19 filings
5. Other Half Brewing - 18 filings

**What This Signals**

Wine dominates January filings at 48% of total volume, consistent with post-holiday inventory positioning. The 61 new company filings represent a 12% increase over the Q4 weekly average of 24 - suggesting new market entry hasn't slowed despite broader volume declines.

Top filer Connoisseur Wines USA at 39 filings is running 2.3x their trailing 4-week average. Worth watching whether this velocity continues or represents a one-time portfolio expansion.

The beer segment shows interesting divergence: craft breweries (Fort George, Other Half, Everywhere Beer) are filing at normal rates while macro players remain quiet. This pattern typically precedes spring release announcements.

## Data Verification Process (MANDATORY)

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every content file must be bulletproof.**

Content credibility depends on data accuracy. A single wrong number destroys trust. Follow this process exactly.

### Step 1: Run All Queries FIRST

Before writing ANY content, execute these queries and save the results:

```bash
# 1. Current period totals
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM colas WHERE year = 2026 AND month = 1"

# 2. Signal breakdown (NEW_COMPANY, NEW_BRAND, NEW_SKU, REFILE)
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT signal, COUNT(*) as count FROM colas WHERE year = 2026 AND month = 1 GROUP BY signal ORDER BY count DESC"

# 3. Top filers
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) as filings FROM colas WHERE year = 2026 AND month = 1 GROUP BY company_name ORDER BY filings DESC LIMIT 10"

# 4. Category breakdown
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT class_type_code, COUNT(*) as count FROM colas WHERE year = 2026 AND month = 1 GROUP BY class_type_code ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 25"

# 5. Historical comparison - same month last year
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM colas WHERE year = 2025 AND month = 1"

# 6. Historical new companies - same month last year
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM colas WHERE year = 2025 AND month = 1 AND signal = 'NEW_COMPANY'"

# 7. New company trend by month (for averages)
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT year, month, COUNT(*) as count FROM colas WHERE signal = 'NEW_COMPANY' AND year >= 2025 GROUP BY year, month ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC"

# 8. Top filers for comparison periods
npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) as filings FROM colas WHERE year = 2025 AND month = 1 GROUP BY company_name ORDER BY filings DESC LIMIT 5"

npx wrangler d1 execute bevalc-colas --remote --command="SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) as filings FROM colas WHERE year = 2025 AND month = 12 GROUP BY company_name ORDER BY filings DESC LIMIT 5"
```

### Step 2: Document All Calculations

For every percentage or comparison in the content, show the math:

```
CALCULATION BLOCK:

Days elapsed: [X]
MTD total: [from query 1]
Run rate: [total] ÷ [days] × [days_in_month] = [result]

YoY comparison:
- Current run rate: [X]
- Same month last year: [from query 5]
- Change: ([current] - [last_year]) ÷ [last_year] = [X]%

New company analysis:
- MTD new companies: [from query 2, NEW_COMPANY signal]
- Run rate: [mtd] ÷ [days] × [days_in_month] = [result]
- Same month last year: [from query 6]
- YoY change: ([current_pace] - [last_year]) ÷ [last_year] = [X]%

Category shares:
- Wine total: [sum of wine categories from query 4]
- Wine %: [wine_total] ÷ [total] = [X]%
- Beer total: [sum of beer categories from query 4]
- Beer %: [beer_total] ÷ [total] = [X]%
```

### Step 3: Build Raw Data Reference Section

Every content file MUST end with a Raw Data Reference section containing:

1. **Query results** - Exact SQL and results for every query run
2. **Calculation block** - Every formula with inputs and outputs
3. **Verification checksums** - Checklist confirming each claim traces to data

Example structure:
```markdown
## Raw Data Reference

**LIVE D1 QUERY RESULTS (Verified [DATE] at time of generation)**

### Query: [Description]
```sql
[Exact SQL]
```
**Result:** [Exact result]

### Calculations
[Show all math]

### Verification Checksums
- [x] [Claim] ← [Query/Calculation that proves it]
- [x] [Claim] ← [Query/Calculation that proves it]
```

### Step 4: Cross-Reference Before Publishing

After content is written, audit EVERY number:

| Claim in Content | Source | Verified |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| "2,698 filings" | Query 1 result | ✓ |
| "43% below Jan 2025" | Calc: (6970-12230)/12230 | ✓ |
| [etc.] | [etc.] | ✓ |

**If any claim cannot be traced to a query result or calculation, DO NOT PUBLISH.**

### Common Calculation Formulas

```
Run rate (partial month):
  total_so_far ÷ days_elapsed × days_in_month

YoY change:
  (current - prior_year) ÷ prior_year × 100

Share of total:
  category_count ÷ total_count × 100

Average (excluding incomplete months):
  sum_of_values ÷ count_of_complete_months
```

### Category Names (Must Match Frontend)

Use these EXACT parent category names to match the frontend dropdown:

| Frontend Category | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Whiskey** | All WHISKY/WHISKEY codes (bourbon, rye, scotch, etc.) |
