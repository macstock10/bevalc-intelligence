# LinkedIn Post Template: Spirits Production Statistics

## Post Types

### 1. Monthly Data Drop
When TTB releases new monthly data (45 days after month end).

**Length:** 150-250 words

**Structure:**
```
[Lead with most striking number]

[2-3 supporting data points]

[Brief "what this means" context]

[Question or forward look]

Source: TTB Distilled Spirits Statistics
Data through {Month Year}
```

**Example:**
```
American distillers produced 112.4 million proof gallons of whisky in October 2024.

That's down 8% from October 2023, continuing a trend of slower production we've tracked for six consecutive months.

The numbers:
- Whisky: 112.4M PG (-8% YoY)
- Vodka: 41.2M PG (-3% YoY)
- Brandy: 8.9M PG (+12% YoY)

1,247 producers reported whisky production. That's 89 more than reported last October.

More producers, less volume. The math points to smaller batches across the industry.

With whisky warehouse inventories near all-time highs, slowing production makes sense. The question: how long before this production slowdown shows up in retail availability?

### 2. Trend Analysis
Quarterly or when notable pattern emerges.

**Length:** 200-300 words

**Structure:**
```
[Pattern statement with timeframe]

[Supporting data across multiple periods]

[What's driving this]

[Industry implication]

[Link to full analysis if article exists]
```

**Example:**
```
Vodka production has declined for 18 consecutive months.

The latest TTB data shows American vodka output at 41.2 million proof gallons in Q3 2024, down from 44.8M in Q3 2023 and 47.1M in Q3 2022.

Three years of declines add up: vodka production is now 13% below its 2021 peak.

But here's what the headline misses: producer count is flat. The 312 vodka producers reporting in 2024 is nearly identical to 2021's 308.

The decline isn't coming from distillery closures. Large producers are scaling back as consumer preferences shift toward whisky and agave spirits.

Smaller craft vodka producers remain active, but they're not moving the volume needle.

This matters for suppliers: grain purchases for vodka production have dropped accordingly. Corn processors that supply neutral spirit operations are feeling it.
