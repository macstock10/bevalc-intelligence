980 new companies entered the alcohol market last week.

Here's who filed with TTB for the first time:

**Notable New Entrants**
| Company | First Brand | Category |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| 1925 Spirits LLC | Leyenda 19 Since 25 | Tequila |

## POST 4: Category Analysis (Wine)
**Post on:** Friday, January 17, 2026 at 10am ET

---

Wine filings represent 66% of all TTB activity last week.

18,707 wine labels filed January 4-10, 2026.

**The Trend**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Wine filings | 18,707 |
| Share of total | 66% |
| New brands | ~3,800 |

**Who's Driving It**
Top wine filers this week:
1. T. Elenteny Holdings - Import specialist
2. Barsac, Inc. - Import/distribution
3. Park Street Imports - Import services
4. Various domestic wineries

**Market Concentration**
The top filers are primarily import specialists rather than wine producers. This reflects the fragmented nature of wine production globally, with thousands of producers relying on US import partners.

**What This Indicates**
Wine's dominance in TTB filings reflects both the category's size and its import-heavy structure. Unlike spirits, where a few large players file most labels, wine filing activity is distributed across thousands of producers working through import partners. The 18,707 weekly filings suggest strong inventory replenishment ahead of spring retail planning.
