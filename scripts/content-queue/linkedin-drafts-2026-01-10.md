## POST 1: Weekly Intelligence Brief
**Post on:** Monday, January 13, 2026 at 9am ET
**Analysis Angle:** Short-term velocity (4-week/13-week benchmarks)

---

1,156 alcohol labels filed with TTB last week.

That's 62% below the 4-week average and 57% below the 13-week average.

**The Numbers**
- Total filings: 1,156
- 4-week avg: 3,019/week
- 13-week avg: 2,661/week
- Same week 2025: ~2,939/week

**Top Filers**
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 34 filings
2. Fort George Brewery - 15 filings
3. Raising Glasses LLC - 14 filings
4. Yee-Haw Brewing - 13 filings
5. Twin Elephant Brewing - 13 filings

**What This Signals**

The holiday hangover is real. First-week January filings typically run 60-70% below monthly averages as the industry returns from break. This week's 1,156 is consistent with that pattern.

More interesting: the 4-week and 13-week moving averages tell different stories. December closed strong at 3,019/week - above Q4's 2,661 average. That suggests the year-end push was real, not just seasonal noise.

Watch next week's numbers. If filings stay below 1,500, it signals continued caution. If they snap back above 2,500, December's strength was genuine demand, not just catch-up from Thanksgiving delays.

The leading indicator isn't total volume - it's NEW_COMPANY filings. Q4 averaged 98/month. December hit 127. That acceleration suggests new market entry hasn't stalled despite the broader slowdown.

## POST 2: Market Movers
**Post on:** Wednesday, January 15, 2026 at 10am ET
**Analysis Angle:** New market entry trends (YoY comparison)

---

34 new companies filed with TTB last week.

How does that compare?

**NEW_COMPANY filings by month (2025):**
| Period | NEW_COMPANY | Weekly Avg |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Jan 2025 | 96 | 22 |
| Apr 2025 (peak) | 140 | 35 |
| Dec 2025 | 127 | 29 |
| Jan 2026 (week 1) | 34 | 34 |

**Notable New Entrants This Week:**
| Company | First Brand | Category |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Still Wild NM LLC | Still Water Distillery | Whisky |
| Belmore International Corp | Esquisito | Tequila |
| Freebrook Imports | Blended Blue | Tequila |
| Oakham Estate Winery | Hartwell Red | Wine |
| Morton Distilleries | Wild Bill's Vodka | Vodka |

**What This Signals**

This week's 34 new companies is actually strong for early January. Last January averaged 22/week. December 2025 averaged 29/week. We're running hot.

The composition matters more than the count. Two of five spirits entrants are tequila-focused (Belmore, Freebrook). Zero are launching gin or flavored vodka as their lead product. The capital is still flowing to agave.

New company formation is the industry's venture capital equivalent. When it accelerates despite a contracting overall market (filings down 22% from 2023 peak), it signals belief that share gains are available. Someone thinks they can take market from incumbents.

Watch Q1's new company total. If it exceeds 300, the "industry in decline" narrative needs revision. Decline in filings doesn't mean decline in competition.

## POST 3: Intent Signals
**Post on:** Thursday, January 16, 2026 at 10am ET
**Analysis Angle:** Top filer composition shift (structural change)

---

The top 5 filers this week are all wine importers or craft breweries.

No major spirits producers. No Diageo. No Brown-Forman. No Constellation.

**This Week's Top Filers:**
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 34 (wine importer)
2. Fort George Brewery - 15 (craft brewery)
3. Raising Glasses LLC - 14 (wine importer)
4. Yee-Haw Brewing - 13 (craft brewery)
5. Twin Elephant Brewing - 13 (craft brewery)

**What This Signals**

The absence of major spirits producers from weekly top-filer lists is now the norm, not the exception. In 2015, Diageo and Brown-Forman routinely appeared in weekly top 10s. Now they file in concentrated bursts - usually quarterly.

This reflects a shift from continuous innovation to campaign-based launches. Large spirits portfolios are mature. New products are planned 18-24 months out and filed in batches aligned to marketing calendars.

Craft breweries, by contrast, file continuously. Fort George, Yee-Haw, and Twin Elephant are all filing line extensions - seasonal releases, collaborations, limited runs. It's a different operating model: high velocity, low stakes per SKU.

Wine importers occupy a third position. Connoisseur and Raising Glasses file for clients - dozens of small European producers who lack US compliance infrastructure. Their volume reflects fragmented international supply, not their own product development.

The structural implication: weekly filing data is now a craft beer and import wine indicator. Spirits activity requires monthly or quarterly views to detect signal.

## POST 4: Category Analysis
**Post on:** Friday, January 17, 2026 at 10am ET
**Analysis Angle:** Long-term category rotation (5-year structural)

---

The beer-to-spirits rotation is now five years old.

**Filing share by category (2020 → 2025):**

| Category | 2020 | 2025 | Change |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| Beer/Malt | 24% | 20% | -4 pts |
| Whiskey | 3.4% | 5.9% | +2.5 pts |
| Agave | 1.1% | 2.1% | +1.0 pts |
| Wine | 64% | 62% | -2 pts |

**Absolute volume (not share):**
- Beer: -27% (39K → 29K filings)
- Wine: -19% (107K → 87K filings)
- Whiskey: +48% (5.6K → 8.4K filings)
- Agave: +56% (1.9K → 2.9K filings)

**What This Signals**

This isn't a cycle. It's a structural reallocation.

The craft beer boom peaked. Between 2010-2020, brewery count grew from 1,800 to 9,000. That growth is now mature - new filings are line extensions from existing players, not new market entry. Beer's share of TTB activity will likely stabilize around 18-19% by 2027.

Brown spirits are the beneficiary. Whiskey and agave together now represent 8% of filings, up from 4.5% in 2020. Both categories are still growing in absolute terms despite the overall market contraction. They're taking share from beer and wine.

The next rotation is already visible: RTD cocktails and functional beverages. These categories barely existed in 2020. Now they're a meaningful share of NEW_BRAND filings - often 10-15% of weekly new brand activity.

For producers: the runway for new craft beer brands is narrow. Differentiation is expensive. For investors: whiskey/agave may be approaching peak capital allocation. The early returns are in. The next opportunity is probably in RTD and functional.

## ANALYSIS ANGLE ROTATION

To ensure variety, rotate analysis angles week-to-week:

**Week 1 (this week):** Short-term velocity (4-week/13-week moving averages)

**Week 3:** Geographic analysis (state-level filing patterns)
**Week 4:** Company spotlight (top filer profile + historical context)
**Week 5 (EOM):** Monthly comparison vs prior months + YoY

**End of Month posts should include:**
