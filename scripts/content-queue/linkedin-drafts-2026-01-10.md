## POST 1: Weekly Intelligence Brief
**Post on:** Monday, January 13, 2026 at 9am ET

1,156 alcohol labels filed with TTB last week.

Here's what the data shows:

**The Numbers**
- Total filings: 1,156
- New brands: 184
- New SKUs: 719
- New market entrants: 34

**Top Filers**
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 34 filings
2. Fort George Brewery - 15 filings
3. Raising Glasses LLC - 14 filings
4. Yee-Haw Brewing - 13 filings
5. Twin Elephant Brewing - 13 filings

**Category Leaders**
- Wine (red + white): 365 filings
- Beer/Ale: 281 filings
- Tequila: 30 filings
- Whiskey: 27 filings

**What This Signals**

The industry is in structural decline. Total TTB filings peaked at 180,255 in 2023 and have dropped 22% since. But the story isn't uniform across categories.

Wine still dominates filing volume (62% of total) but is shrinking in absolute terms. Beer is declining faster - from 24% of filings in 2020 to 20% in 2025. Craft brewery formation has slowed considerably from its 2021 peak.

Meanwhile, brown spirits continue their quiet takeover. Whiskey filings grew 48% since 2020 despite overall market contraction. Agave spirits (tequila/mezcal) grew 56% over the same period.

This week's data reflects that shift: four of the top five filers are craft breweries, but they're filing line extensions (62% are NEW_SKU), not launching new brands. The growth is coming from spirits.

## POST 2: Market Movers
**Post on:** Wednesday, January 15, 2026 at 10am ET

34 new companies entered the alcohol market last week.

First-time filers with TTB for January 4-10, 2026:

**Notable New Entrants**
| Company | First Brand | Category |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Still Wild NM LLC | Still Water Distillery | Whisky |
| Oakham Estate Winery | Hartwell Red | Wine |
| Belmore International Corp | Esquisito | Tequila |
| Freebrook Imports | Blended Blue | Tequila |
| Morton Distilleries | Wild Bill's Vodka | Vodka |

**What This Signals**

New market entry has slowed significantly. In 2021, we averaged 85 new companies per week. In 2025, that dropped to 52. This week's 34 continues the trend.

But where new entrants are placing their bets is telling. Half of the spirits-focused new entrants this week are in agave or whiskey. None are launching vodka brands as their primary focus - the one vodka filer (Morton Distilleries) is a craft distillery with whiskey roots.

Wine and beer still attract new entrants, but the venture-backed spirits gold rush is over. What remains are smaller, regional operators: New Mexico craft distilleries, Virginia estate wineries, New Jersey import companies.

The low barrier to entry that defined 2018-2022 is giving way to a more capital-intensive environment. Expect consolidation.

## POST 3: Intent Signals
**Post on:** Thursday, January 16, 2026 at 10am ET

Connoisseur Wines USA filed 34 labels last week.

That positions them as the top filer for the first week of 2026.

**Filing Profile**
- Filings: 34
- Category focus: Wine imports
- Primary activity: European portfolio expansion

**What This Signals**

Import specialists now dominate weekly filing charts. The top filers in any given week are rarely producers - they're logistics companies: importers of record, custom crush facilities, and compliance shops.

This structural shift matters. In 2015, the top weekly filers were typically large producers (Diageo, Constellation, E&J Gallo). Today, it's Connoisseur Wines, T. Elenteny Holdings, MHW Ltd, and Park Street Imports.

What changed? The fragmentation of global alcohol production. There are now 12,000+ wineries in Europe, 3,000+ mezcal producers in Oaxaca, and 2,000+ craft distilleries in the US. Most lack the resources to navigate TTB compliance directly.

The import specialists have become the infrastructure layer. Their filing velocity reflects demand from thousands of small producers seeking US market access. When their filings slow, it signals reduced international supply or weakening US demand. Neither has happened yet.

## POST 4: Category Analysis
**Post on:** Friday, January 17, 2026 at 10am ET

The beer-spirits rotation continues.

Five-year filing trends tell the story:

**Beer/Malt (share of total filings):**
- 2020: 24%
- 2023: 22%
- 2025: 20%

**Whiskey (share of total filings):**
- 2020: 3.4%
- 2023: 4.3%
- 2025: 5.9%

**Agave spirits (share of total filings):**
- 2020: 1.1%
- 2023: 1.4%
- 2025: 2.1%

**What This Signals**

The craft beer boom that defined 2010-2020 is structurally over. Filing share has declined for five consecutive years. The category isn't dying - it's mature. The innovation cycle has shifted from "new brewery launches" to "line extensions from existing players."

This week's data reflects that reality: 62% of filings are NEW_SKU (existing brands adding products), while only 16% are NEW_BRAND launches.

Meanwhile, brown spirits continue gaining. Whiskey's filing share has nearly doubled since 2020. Agave has also doubled. These aren't cyclical swings - they're structural shifts in where capital and entrepreneurial energy are flowing.

For producers: the runway for new craft beer brands is narrowing. For investors: the spirits opportunity window is also closing. The next wave of growth likely comes from RTD cocktails and functional beverages - categories that barely registered in 2020 and now represent a meaningful share of new filings.
