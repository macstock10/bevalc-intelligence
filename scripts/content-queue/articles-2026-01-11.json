    "content_markdown": "# 21,633 Labels Were Filed This Week. Here Are Some of Them.\n\nThe TTB approved 21,633 label applications between January 5th and January 11th, 2026. That is a lot of labels. Someone had to look at each one. I think about that person sometimes.\n\n## The Numbers\n\n5,615 of these were new brands. First-timers. People who woke up one morning and decided the beverage alcohol market needed another entrant. 787 of them were from companies filing for the first time ever. The optimism is almost touching.\n\n6,241 were new SKUs from existing brands. Line extensions. Variants. The belief that what the world needs is the same whiskey but aged two months longer, or the same wine but from a different vineyard that is seventeen feet to the left of the original vineyard.\n\n8,990 were refiles. Labels that already existed but needed to be filed again. I do not know why. The TTB does not explain these things to me. They just approve them.\n\n## Wine Is Still Wine\n\nTable red wine led with 5,192 filings. Table white wine followed with 3,725. This is not surprising. Wine has been doing this for a while now. Several thousand years, depending on how you count.\n\nAdventures in Wine, operating out of Barsac, Inc., filed 213 labels this week. That is more than one per hour if you assume they work eight-hour days. I do not know if they work eight-hour days. I am speculating.\n\n## Tree House Is Still Tree House\n\nTree House Brewing Company filed 178 labels. They are the second most active filer this week. They make IPAs. Hazy ones, mostly. The kind that look like orange juice and cost fourteen dollars for a four-pack. People seem to like them. I have never been to their brewery. It is in Massachusetts.\n\n## The Name That Stopped Me\n\nA company called AlphaBeta Brewery filed a whiskey called \"ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATE COUNSEL.\"\n\nI read that several times. It is real. It is in the database. The TTB approved it on January 8th, 2026.\n\nI do not know why a brewery is making whiskey. I do not know why they named it after what appears to be a legal trade organization. I do not know if actual corporate counsel are involved. I am not going to call them to ask.\n\nThe class type is listed as WHISKY. Not WHISKEY. The distinction matters to some people.\n\n## Other Names of Note\n\nEquilibrium Brewery filed something called \"GHOST IN THE LABORATORY.\" It is an ale. The ghost is not specified. Maybe it is a metaphor. Maybe there was an incident.\n\nVicious Fishes Brewery - which is a real company and not something I made up - filed \"DOUBLE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE\" and \"HERE BE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE\" in the same week. They are committed to the dragon theme. Maroni Beverage Company handles their paperwork.\n\nMandatory Fun Beer Works filed \"WILD AND CRAZY.\" The brewery is called Mandatory Fun. The beer is called Wild and Crazy. There is a tension there that I find interesting. Forced enjoyment that is also unhinged. A contradiction. Or maybe not. I did not study philosophy.\n\n## The Four Loko Update\n\nFour Loko filed a new variant called \"STORM.\" This is the fourteenth new Four Loko filing I have tracked in the past six months. They are still out there. Still innovating. Still presumably being consumed by people at gas stations at 11pm. The brand persists.\n\n## Burial Beer Is Making Wine Now\n\nBurial Beer Co., which is a brewery in Asheville, North Carolina, filed a table red wine called \"VISUALS\" with a fanciful name of \"CONJURED IN SHADOWS.\"\n\nI do not know when breweries started making wine. I do not know if this is common. The filing is there. It happened. Someone at the TTB looked at an application from a company with \"Beer\" in the name for a wine product and approved it. They probably did not think twice about it. They see a lot of applications.\n\n## What It Means\n\nI do not know what it means. I just read the filings. 21,633 of them happened. Wine dominated. Beer held steady. A lawyer whiskey exists now. The market continues.\n\nThese are the things that occurred.\n\n---\n\n*Data from TTB COLA filings, week ending January 11, 2026.

    "content_markdown": "# Tree House Filed 178 Labels This Week. They Do This A Lot.\n\nTree House Brewing Company, Inc. filed 178 label applications with the TTB between January 5th and January 11th, 2026. That made them the second most active filer of the week, behind only Adventures in Wine.\n\nThis is not unusual for them. Tree House files a lot of labels. They are a brewery in Massachusetts that specializes in IPAs. Hazy IPAs, mostly. The kind that are opaque and golden and photograph well for Instagram. People drive considerable distances to buy them.\n\n## What They Filed\n\nMost of the 178 filings appear to be variants. New batches. Small adjustments to existing products. The TTB requires a new filing when certain things change. I do not know exactly what those things are. The regulations exist. They are followed.\n\nSome of the product names are straightforward. Some are less so. Tree House has a history of naming beers things that are not obviously beer names. This week appears to be more of the same.\n\n## The Business Model\n\nTree House does not distribute widely. You have to go there. Or you have to know someone who went there. This has created a secondary market. It has also created a brewery that apparently has the capacity to file 178 labels in a single week while maintaining the mystique of scarcity.\n\nI do not know how this works economically. They seem to be doing fine.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIt does not, particularly. A brewery filed some labels. The TTB approved them. Beer will be made. People will drink it. Some of those people will post about it online. The cycle continues.\n\nBut if you are tracking who is active in the TTB database, Tree House is active. Very active. Consistently active. Whatever they are doing, they are doing a lot of it.\n\n---\n\n*[View all Tree House Brewing Company filings](/company/tree-house-brewing-company-inc)*",

I do not fully understand craft beer economics.",

      "headline": "The Corporate Counsel Whiskey Situation",
      "story": "AlphaBeta Brewery filed a whiskey called 'Association of Corporate Counsel' on January 8th, 2026. The TTB approved it.\n\nThere are several things to unpack here. First, AlphaBeta Brewery is a brewery. Breweries make beer. This is whiskey. Second, 'Association of Corporate Counsel' is the name of an actual organization. It has over 45,000 members. They are lawyers.\n\nI do not know if the actual Association of Corporate Counsel is aware of this whiskey. I do not know if they licensed their name. I do not know if this is a collaboration or a coincidence or something else entirely.\n\nThe filing lists the location as somewhere I cannot fully make out. The class type is WHISKY, spelled the Scottish way, without the E. This suggests something about the production method or the origin or nothing at all.\n\nA whiskey named after lawyers, made by a brewery, approved by the federal government. This is the beverage industry in 2026."

      "story": "Vicious Fishes Brewery filed two dragon-themed IPAs in the same week. 'DOUBLE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE' and 'HERE BE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE.'\n\nThe company is called Vicious Fishes. They make beers about dragons. I do not know how to reconcile this. Fish are not dragons. Dragons are not fish. Perhaps there is a mythology I am unaware of.\n\nMaroni Beverage Company handles their paperwork. Someone at Maroni had to type 'DOUBLE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE' into the TTB system. They did this. The TTB looked at it. They approved it.\n\nThe beers are presumably different. You do not file two labels for the same beer. There is a Double Dragons and there is a Here Be Dragons and these are distinct products with distinct recipes that both involve dragons.\n\nI have not tasted either one. I do not know if they taste like dragons. I do not know what dragons taste like. This is speculation."

      "story": "There is a brewery called Mandatory Fun Beer Works. This is the actual name of a business that exists and files federal paperwork.\n\nThis week they filed a beer called 'WILD AND CRAZY.'\n\nThe juxtaposition is interesting. Fun is mandatory. It is required. You will have it. But also, be wild. Be crazy. Within the mandatory fun parameters, presumably.\n\nThe company is listed under Arcanum Ventures, LLC. Arcanum means 'secret' or 'mystery.' So we have a secret venture company running a mandatory fun brewery that makes wild and crazy beer.\n\nI do not know what is happening in the craft beer industry. I just read the filings."
