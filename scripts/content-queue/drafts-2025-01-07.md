**Variation 1:**
TTB just approved a beer name longer than most tweets. Burial Beer's new FMB: "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Asheville stays undefeated. (NEW_SKU, 05/14/2025)

**Variation 2:**
The TTB compliance officer who had to type out "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness" deserves a raise. New Burial Beer FMB approved. 🍺

**Variation 3:**
Burial Beer Co. didn't name a beer. They filed a philosophy dissertation with the TTB. 17 words. Zero apologies. Approved 05/14/2025.

**Variation 1:**
**When Your Product Name Is Also Your Brand Statement**

Burial Beer Co. just received TTB approval for a flavored malt beverage called "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

At 17 words, it's one of the longest product names we've tracked in our database of 1.6M+ COLA filings.

This isn't just creative naming—it's strategic differentiation. In a crowded craft beverage market, Burial Beer (Asheville, NC) continues to build a brand identity that's impossible to ignore or imitate.

The TTB approved this NEW_SKU on 05/14/2025. Say what you will about the name, but you won't forget it.

What's the most memorable beverage name you've encountered?

**Variation 2:**
**The Art of Standing Out in TTB Filings**

I spend my days analyzing beverage alcohol label approvals. After reviewing over 1.6 million COLA records, I thought I'd seen it all.

Then Burial Beer Co. filed "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

A few observations:

- This is a legitimate TTB-approved product name
- It's a flavored malt beverage from Asheville, NC
- The approval came through on 05/14/2025
- It takes commitment to type that into a federal database

Burial has built their brand on this kind of existential irreverence. In an industry where "Smooth" and "Reserve" dominate naming conventions, they chose to file a mood.

The data shows it's working—they continue to expand their SKU portfolio with distinctive products that generate organic conversation.

**Variation 3:**
**What TTB Filings Reveal About Brand Strategy**

Every week, we track thousands of new label approvals. Most follow predictable patterns. Then there's Burial Beer Co.

Their latest approved product name: "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness"

This isn't naming by committee. It's a deliberate brand choice that:

1. Creates instant memorability
2. Signals their target consumer (craft-forward, intellectually curious)
3. Generates earned media (like this post)
4. Differentiates on the shelf without paid advertising

Filed from Asheville, NC. Approved 05/14/2025. Category: Flavored Malt Beverage.

The craft beverage industry rewards authenticity. Burial understood the assignment.

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Flavored Malt Beverage
- Company: Evil Twin Brewing, Charlie Work LLC
- Approved: 04/11/2025
- Signal: NEW_SKU

### X (Twitter) Posts

**Variation 1:**
Evil Twin's new beer is either a product name or a critique of modern craft brewing: "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." Self-aware king behavior. 👑

**Variation 2:**

### LinkedIn Posts

**Variation 1:**
**When Your Product Name Is Industry Commentary**

Evil Twin Brewing just received TTB approval for: "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

Let that sink in.

One of craft beer's most provocative brands just filed what reads like a satirical take on modern brewing trends—as an actual product. It's simultaneously:

- A legitimate flavored malt beverage
- A commentary on lactose-heavy pastry stouts
- A nod to the fruit-forward hazy movement
- Excellent marketing

Filed through Charlie Work LLC, approved 04/11/2025.

Evil Twin has always straddled the line between craft brewer and industry critic. This filing suggests they're not just participating in trends—they're documenting them in real-time through their TTB submissions.

The meta-brewery era has arrived.

**Variation 2:**
**Data Point or Cultural Commentary?**

Our platform tracks 1.6M+ beverage alcohol label approvals. Sometimes a filing tells a bigger story.

Evil Twin Brewing's latest: "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

This name essentially describes the trajectory of craft beer innovation over the past five years:

- Lactose additions became standard
- Fruit-forward profiles dominate taproom menus
- "Luxurious" and "decadent" are now category expectations

By naming a product after the trend itself, Evil Twin is doing something clever: acknowledging market reality while gently mocking it. And they got TTB approval for the critique.

Approved: 04/11/2025
Category: Flavored Malt Beverage
Company: Evil Twin Brewing, Charlie Work LLC

Sometimes the most interesting industry analysis comes from the filings themselves.

**Variation 3:**
**The Brewery That Files Think Pieces**

I've analyzed thousands of TTB label approvals. Evil Twin Brewing consistently files the most thought-provoking names in the industry.

Their latest approved product: "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

Breaking this down:

"Extra Milk Sugar" - Lactose additions are now ubiquitous in craft
"Three Varieties of Fruit" - The more fruit, the better (apparently)
"Luxurious Treatment" - Premium positioning through ingredient excess

Evil Twin isn't just making beer. They're filing timestamps of craft beverage culture. Each TTB submission doubles as commentary.

Whether you see this as brilliant branding or industry eye-roll, you're talking about it. That's the point.

Approval date: 04/11/2025 | Category: FMB | NEW_SKU

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Rye Whisky
- Company: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company LLC
- Approved: 12/12/2025
- Signal: NEW_COMPANY (first-time filer)

### X (Twitter) Posts

**Variation 1:**
NEW_COMPANY alert: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company just made their first-ever TTB filing. A rye whisky. The name suggests they won't be seldom seen for long. (12/12/2025)

**Variation 2:**
First TTB filing spotted for Seldom Seen Whiskey Company—a new rye whisky producer entering the market. In our database of 1.6M+ records, they're now officially "seen." Welcome to the industry. 🥃

**Variation 3:**
Seldom Seen Whiskey Company: first-time filer, rye whisky, approved 12/12/2025. Another new entrant in American whiskey. The category keeps growing. 📈

### LinkedIn Posts

**Variation 1:**
**Tracking New Entrants: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company**

One of the most valuable signals in our TTB filing data: NEW_COMPANY classifications.

These represent first-time filers—brands entering the federal regulatory system for the first time. It's often our earliest indicator of new market entrants.

This week's notable debut: **Seldom Seen Whiskey Company LLC**

- Category: Rye Whisky
- Approval Date: 12/12/2025
- Signal: NEW_COMPANY (first-ever filing)

The American whiskey category continues to attract new producers. Rye, in particular, has seen sustained growth as consumers explore beyond bourbon.

We'll be watching to see if Seldom Seen expands their portfolio or focuses on a single flagship expression. Their filing history starts now.

**Variation 2:**
**The Birth of a Whiskey Brand (As Told By TTB Data)**

Every established whiskey brand was once a first-time filer.

On 12/12/2025, we recorded a NEW_COMPANY signal for Seldom Seen Whiskey Company LLC. Their debut filing: a rye whisky.

What we know:
- First-ever TTB submission
- Entering the competitive American rye category
- Brand name suggests limited/allocated positioning

What we don't know yet:
- Production source (distilled in-house or sourced?)
- Distribution strategy
- Price positioning

This is exactly why we track NEW_COMPANY signals. They represent the earliest public evidence of new market participants—often before press releases, before retail placement, before consumer awareness.

Seldom Seen just became seen. We'll track their journey.

**Variation 3:**
**New Whiskey Producer Alert**

Our system flagged a NEW_COMPANY filing this week: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company LLC.

Details from the TTB approval (12/12/2025):
- Product: Rye Whisky
- Company Status: First-time filer
- Signal Classification: NEW_COMPANY

The American whiskey landscape continues to evolve. While established players dominate volume, new entrants keep emerging—each with a thesis on what the market wants.

"Seldom Seen" as a brand name signals scarcity and exclusivity. In a category where allocated bottles drive collector interest, the positioning is intentional.

First filing recorded. Brand journey begins.

## 4. DSSOLVR - "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Beer
- Company: DSSOLVR, LLC (Asheville, NC)
- Approved: 12/04/2025
- Signal: REFILE

### X (Twitter) Posts

**Variation 1:**
DSSOLVR filed a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." It's a REFILE, meaning this salad-meets-pizza-meets-beer already exists and they're updating the label. Asheville gonna Asheville. 🍕🍺

**Variation 2:**
The TTB database now contains "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" and it's not a restaurant menu—it's a beer. DSSOLVR (Asheville) refiled 12/04/2025. The food-beer naming convergence continues.

**Variation 3:**
"Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" is not a Whole Foods prepared food item. It's a TTB-approved beer from DSSOLVR. REFILE dated 12/04/2025. I have questions. 🤔

### LinkedIn Posts

**Variation 1:**
**When Food Becomes Beer (Literally)**

DSSOLVR, an Asheville-based brewery, just refiled their product "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

Yes, that's a beer. Yes, it's TTB-approved. Yes, we have thoughts.

The food-as-beer-name trend has accelerated in recent years. We've tracked everything from breakfast cereals to desserts. But "Cold Caprese Pizza" might be the most aggressively specific culinary reference we've seen.

Filing details:
- Category: Beer
- Company: DSSOLVR, LLC (Asheville, NC)
- Date: 12/04/2025
- Signal: REFILE (label update for existing product)

The REFILE classification means this product already exists—they're updating the label, not launching something new. Which means this name has already proven itself in market.

Asheville continues to push creative boundaries in craft beverage naming.

**Variation 2:**
**The Evolution of Beer Naming Conventions**

Traditional beer names: geographical references, founder names, style descriptors.

Modern craft beer names: "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

DSSOLVR (Asheville, NC) refiled this product on 12/04/2025. The REFILE signal indicates a label update rather than a new product launch—meaning consumers have already encountered this name.

A few observations from our filing data:

1. Food-reference names have increased significantly in craft beer
2. The more specific the food, the more memorable the product
3. Asheville producers are disproportionately represented in creative naming

Whether "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" describes actual flavor notes or exists purely as attention-grabbing wordplay, it achieves differentiation. In a category with thousands of SKUs, that matters.

**Variation 3:**
**TTB Filing of the Week: Food Edition**

Every week we review thousands of label approvals. DSSOLVR's "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" stopped us mid-scroll.

The breakdown:
- Fresh Hop: Actual brewing technique (using just-harvested hops)
- Cold Caprese: The Italian salad... served cold?
- Pizza: Because why not

This is a REFILE (12/04/2025), meaning DSSOLVR is updating an existing product's label. The name has already been in market.

From Asheville, NC—a region that consistently produces the most creatively-named beverages in our database.

I'd genuinely like to know if this beer tastes like pizza. The TTB filing doesn't specify.

### LinkedIn Posts

**Variation 1:**
**Sports Licensing Enters the Whisky Category**

NEW_BRAND alert: Aurelian Reserve just made their debut TTB filing with an interesting angle—"Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference."

Key details:
- Category: Whisky Specialties
- Company: Bespoken Spirits, Inc.
- Approval: 12/19/2025
- Signal: NEW_BRAND (first filing under this brand name)

This filing represents the intersection of two trends:
1. Sports organizations monetizing brand equity through licensing
2. Spirits companies seeking differentiation through partnerships

Bespoken Spirits is known for their accelerated aging technology. Launching a new brand with collegiate sports tie-in suggests a strategy beyond traditional whisky positioning.

The Atlantic 10 includes schools like Dayton, VCU, and Saint Louis—markets with passionate basketball fanbases. A commemorative whisky could find receptive audiences.

We'll track whether Aurelian Reserve expands beyond this anniversary release.

**Variation 2:**
**The Convergence of Sports and Spirits**

Our TTB tracking just flagged an interesting NEW_BRAND filing: Aurelian Reserve.

Their debut product? A whisky celebrating the Atlantic 10 Conference's 50th anniversary.

This caught our attention for several reasons:

1. **New brand launch** - First-ever filing under Aurelian Reserve name
2. **Sports licensing** - Conference anniversary as product theme
3. **Strategic backer** - Bespoken Spirits (known for tech-forward whisky production)

The sports memorabilia market is massive. Extending that into consumable products—limited edition spirits tied to milestones—creates urgency and collector appeal.

Filed: 12/19/2025
Category: Whisky Specialties
Signal: NEW_BRAND

Is this the beginning of a broader play into sports-licensed spirits? The filing data suggests Bespoken is testing the concept.

**Variation 3:**
**NEW_BRAND Analysis: Aurelian Reserve**

We track brand debuts closely. A new entrant's first filing often signals their market positioning.

Aurelian Reserve's opening move: a whisky celebrating the Atlantic 10 Conference's 50th anniversary.

What this tells us:
- **Target consumer**: Sports fans, alumni networks, collectors
- **Distribution thesis**: Regional focus on A-10 markets (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest)
- **Timing play**: Anniversary editions create natural urgency
- **Production partner**: Bespoken Spirits brings technical capability

The "Whisky Specialties" classification suggests this may include flavoring or finishing elements—common for commemorative releases that prioritize accessibility over purist appeal.

First filing: 12/19/2025. Brand journey begins.
