TTB approved a beer called "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Seventeen words. I counted. Someone at the TTB had to type that into a federal database. They get paid by the hour, I assume. I hope. Anyway it's from Asheville.

**Post 2:**
Burial Beer filed a product with the TTB. The name is seventeen words long. I'm not going to type it all out again. You can look it up. Someone at a government office already did. Flavored malt beverage. Asheville, North Carolina. Approved in May.

**Post 3:**
I feel for the compliance officer who typed "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness" into a federal database. Seventeen words. All of them spelled correctly. That's professionalism. Burial Beer. Asheville. May 14th.

Burial Beer filed a beer with the federal government. The name of the beer is "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

That is the actual name. All seventeen words of it. Someone at the TTB had to type that into a database. Someone else had to approve it. Both of those people went home afterward and did not think about it again, probably.

The beer is from Asheville. It was approved in May. It is a flavored malt beverage, which means it is technically beer but also technically not beer in the way that a hot dog is technically a sandwich but you would never call it that.

Anyway. That is the update.

**Post 2:**
I think about the TTB a lot. Probably too much.

Someone works there. Multiple someones. They come in every day and review label applications. "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Approved. Just like that.

Do they laugh? Do they sigh? Do they have a group chat where they share the weird ones? I like to think they do. I like to think there's a guy named Doug who texts his wife about the strange beer names. "You won't believe this one, Karen." Maybe her name isn't Karen. I don't know these people.

Burial Beer. Asheville. Flavored malt beverage. May 14th, 2025. Seventeen words in the product name. I counted because that's what I do now.

## 2. EVIL TWIN BREWING - "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Flavored Malt Beverage
- Company: Evil Twin Brewing
- Approved: 12/30/2025

**Post 1:**
Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." I think they're making fun of the industry. Or themselves. Or me, specifically. Hard to say. Anyway that's 22 words. Longer than the Burial Beer one. We're in an arms race now.

**Post 2:**
"The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." That's a beer name. Evil Twin filed it with the government. The government approved it. This is a real thing that happened. Someone typed it into a federal database.

**Post 3:**
Evil Twin Brewing named a beer after what every craft brewery has been doing for five years. They just said it out loud. In a TTB filing. Twenty-two words. I don't know if it's satire or self-awareness or both. The TTB approved it anyway. December 30th.

Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

Twenty-two words. I counted. That's five more than the Burial Beer name from May. I don't know if they're competing. I don't know if they know each other. I don't know why I'm keeping track.

The name reads like a critique of modern craft brewing. Or maybe it's just what the beer contains. Or both. The TTB doesn't distinguish between irony and sincerity. They just approve labels.

It was filed December 30th. Right before the new year. Someone at Evil Twin submitted this as their last act of 2025. Someone at the TTB approved it as one of their first acts of 2026, probably. I don't actually know the exact timeline. I'm not going to look it up.

**Post 2:**
I've looked at 1.6 million label filings. Most of them are normal. "Reserve." "Select." "Premium." Standard stuff.

Then there's Evil Twin Brewing, who filed "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

I think they're describing modern craft beer. The lactose. The fruit additions. The marketing language. They put it all in the product name. Like a confession, maybe. Or a mission statement. Or just a very long joke.

The TTB approved it. They approve most things. This one they probably had questions about. Or maybe they didn't. Hard to say what goes on over there.

Flavored malt beverage. December 30th, 2025. Twenty-two words. That's the update.

## 3. SELDOM SEEN WHISKEY COMPANY - "Seldom Seen"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Rye Whisky
- Company: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company
- Signal: NEW_COMPANY (first-time filer)
- Approved: 01/02/2026

### X Posts

**Post 1:**
A company called Seldom Seen Whiskey filed their first label with the TTB last week. It is a rye. The name is either very clever or very unclever. I have not decided. First filing. January 2nd. They're in the database now.

**Post 2:**
New company alert: Seldom Seen Whiskey filed their first label. Rye whiskey. Before today, they were completely unknown. Now they're in my database. And this post. So they're not seldom seen anymore. I've ruined it for them. Sorry.

**Post 3:**
Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First TTB filing. Rye whisky. The name is either very optimistic or very pessimistic depending on how you read it. I have not decided which. January 2nd, 2026. They exist now, officially.

A new company showed up in the database this week. Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First-ever TTB filing. A rye whisky.

I don't know anything about them. The filing doesn't tell me much. Just that they exist now, in the eyes of the federal government. That's how it starts. You file a label. It gets approved. Then you're real.

The name is either very clever or very unclever. "Seldom Seen" could mean rare and exclusive. Or it could mean nobody's buying it. Marketing is complicated.

January 2nd, 2026. First filing recorded. Brand journey begins. Or doesn't. The database doesn't tell you what happens next. Just that they showed up.

**Post 2:**
Every established whiskey brand was once a first-time filer. Maker's Mark. Buffalo Trace. All of them. Someone submitted paperwork, and it got approved, and then they existed.

On January 2nd, 2026, we recorded a new first-time filer: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. Their debut filing is a rye whisky.

What do I know about them? Almost nothing. The TTB filing tells you the company name, the product type, the approval date. That's it. Everything else is speculation.

The name suggests scarcity. Or maybe obscurity. Hard to market a whiskey as "seldom seen" once everyone's seen it. But that's their problem, not mine.

I track the filings. What happens after is someone else's story.

## 4. DSSOLVR - "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Specialty Beer
- Company: DSSOLVR (Asheville, NC)
- Approved: 12/23/2025

### X Posts

**Post 1:**
Someone made a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." I have questions. I'm not going to ask them. Some things you just accept. TTB approved it. That's enough for me. DSSOLVR. Asheville. December 23rd.

**Post 2:**
"Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" is not a menu item. It is a beer. DSSOLVR filed it with the TTB. The TTB approved it. We all just have to live with that now. Asheville, North Carolina. Right before Christmas.

**Post 3:**
There's a beer called Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza. I don't know if it tastes like pizza. I don't know if it should. I don't know who asked for this. Someone did, apparently. The TTB approved it. DSSOLVR. Asheville. December 23rd.

DSSOLVR filed a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

I'm going to give you a moment with that.

It's from Asheville. Of course it's from Asheville. Approved December 23rd, right before Christmas. Specialty beer category.

I don't know if it tastes like pizza. I don't know if fresh hops taste like caprese salad. I don't know what "cold" is modifying in that sentence. The caprese? The pizza? The entire concept?

The TTB approved it. They don't judge. They just process paperwork. Someone typed "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" into a federal database and nobody stopped them.

That's the update. I don't have analysis. I just have the fact that this exists now.

**Post 2:**
I've looked at a lot of beer names. After 1.6 million label approvals, you think you've seen everything. Then someone files "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

It's from DSSOLVR in Asheville. The TTB approved it December 23rd. It's a specialty beer.

I have several questions:
- Is it pizza-flavored?
- Is caprese salad involved somehow?
- What makes it "cold"?
- Why?

I'm not going to get answers to these questions. The TTB filing doesn't include tasting notes. It doesn't explain the creative process. It just says: this product exists, here's the name, approved.

Someone at the TTB had to read this name out loud. In a government office. Two days before Christmas. Then they typed it into a database. Then they went home, probably. I think about this person sometimes.

## 5. AURELIAN RESERVE (Bespoken Spirits) - "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Whisky
- Company: Bespoken Spirits
- Approved: 12/19/2025

### X Posts

**Post 1:**
There is now a whiskey commemorating the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Atlantic 10 is a college basketball conference. The whiskey is from Bespoken Spirits. I do not have strong feelings about either of these things but I thought you should know.

**Post 2:**
Aurelian Reserve filed a whisky for the 50th anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference. I didn't know this was a category. Conference-branded whisky. I looked it up. It might be the first one. Or maybe it isn't. I didn't look that hard.

**Post 3:**
Someone at a marketing agency pitched this: "What if we made a whisky for mid-major basketball fans." And someone else said yes. And now it's in a government database. Aurelian Reserve. Atlantic 10 Conference. 50th anniversary. That's how things happen.

Someone at a marketing agency pitched this. "What if we made a whisky for mid-major basketball fans." And someone else said yes. And now it's in a government database. That's how things happen. Someone says something. Someone else agrees. Then it's real.

Aurelian Reserve. Bespoken Spirits. December 19th. Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball, commemorated in whisky form.

I don't have a take on this. I just noticed it. Make of it what you will.

**Post 2:**
The Atlantic 10 Conference has a whisky now. Filed by Bespoken Spirits under the brand name Aurelian Reserve. Approved December 19th.

The A-10 is a mid-major basketball conference. Dayton, VCU, Saint Louis. Schools like that. Someone decided those fans needed their own commemorative whisky for the conference's 50th anniversary.

I don't know if this is a trend. Sports licensing for spirits. Maybe it is. Maybe every conference will have a whisky soon. The Big Ten Bourbon. The SEC Scotch. The Pac-12 - well, the Pac-12 doesn't exist anymore. Forget that one.

Anyway. Aurelian Reserve. Atlantic 10. Fifty years. Whisky. That's the filing. I don't know what else to tell you.

## HONORABLE MENTIONS

### YAO FAMILY WINES - Yao Ming's Wine Label

**X Post:**
Yao Ming has a wine label. The basketball player. He's in the wine business now. Retired from basketball, started making wine. That's the dream, I guess. Play professional sports, then make wine. I didn't play professional sports. I made a database. We all end up somewhere.

### GHOST FACE VODKA - Wu-Tang Themed Vodka

**X Post:**
There's a vodka called Ghost Face now. Like the Wu-Tang member. Or the Scream mask. Or both. I don't know which came first. The TTB approved it. Manifest Distilling. December 2025. Wu-Tang is still finding new revenue streams after all these years.

### PICKLE SHINE - Pickle-Flavored Moonshine

**X Post:**
So there's a pickle moonshine now. "Pickle Shine." From Madhatter Distillery. I'm not going to editorialize on this. It exists. The TTB approved it. Someone wanted pickle-flavored moonshine badly enough to file the paperwork. That's dedication, I suppose.

### YEAR OF THE HORSE - Luzhou Laojiao Baijiu

**X Post:**
Luzhou Laojiao filed a "Year of the Horse" limited edition baijiu. Chinese New Year planning, a few months out. 2026 is the Year of the Snake, actually. Wait. Maybe it's for 2027. Or they got the animal wrong. I don't know. It's in the database. Someone will figure it out.

**LinkedIn Post (Combined Honorable Mentions):**
A few other filings that caught my attention this week:

Yao Ming's wine label filed another product. The basketball player turned winemaker. It happens more than you'd think. Athletes retire, buy vineyards. I don't know if it's a good investment. I just track the filings.

There's a vodka called Ghost Face now. From Manifest Distilling. Like the Wu-Tang member or the horror movie mask, depending on who you ask. Or both. The TTB doesn't require you to explain your references.

Pickle Shine. That's a pickle-flavored moonshine. From Madhatter Distillery. I've seen three pickle-flavored spirits this month. Unrelated companies. Different states. I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying three. It's probably nothing.

And someone filed a "Year of the Horse" baijiu for Chinese New Year. Premium Chinese spirit. Limited edition. These show up every year around this time. Different animal each time. That's how the zodiac works.

1.6 million filings in the database. These are just four of them. There are many more. Some are interesting. Most are not. This job is mostly looking at the ones that aren't. Then you find one that is, and you write about it. That's the whole thing.
