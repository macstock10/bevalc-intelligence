TTB approved a beer called "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Seventeen words. I counted. Someone at the TTB typed that into a federal database and then, I assume, went to lunch. Asheville. Flavored malt beverage. May 14th.

**Post 2:**
Burial Beer filed a product name that's longer than most wedding vows. Seventeen words. No periods. Just one long thought about existential disappointment. The TTB approved it. They approve most things. This one they probably read twice. Or didn't read at all. Hard to say.

**Post 3:**
I feel for the compliance officer who had to verify the spelling of "Unabashedly" and "Contrived" and "Meaninglessness" in a beer name. Burial Beer. Asheville. Seventeen words. All spelled correctly. That's the federal government at work.

Burial Beer filed a beer with the TTB. The name is "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

Seventeen words. I counted because that's what I do now. Count words in beer names. I don't know when this became my life but here we are.

This has nothing to do with anything, but my uncle used to say the best beer names were three words or less. He said four words was pushing it. He drank Budweiser. Died in 2014. Never saw a seventeen-word beer name. Probably for the best.

Where was I. Right. The beer. It's a flavored malt beverage. From Asheville. Approved in May. Someone typed the whole thing into a government database. Someone else approved it. Both of those people went home afterward and didn't think about it again, probably. Or maybe they did. I don't know these people.

**Post 2:**
I think about the TTB a lot. Probably too much.

There's an office somewhere. Federal building. Someone sits at a desk and reviews label applications all day. "Miller Lite." Approved. "Bud Light." Approved. "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

Pause.

Reread.

Approved.

Funny story. I used to work with a guy who processed insurance claims. He said the weird ones were the only thing that got him through the day. The normal ones all blurred together. I asked if he kept a list of the weird ones. He said he used to but his manager made him stop. Said it was unprofessional. He quit in 2019. Moved to Portland. No, Seattle. One of those.

Anyway. Burial Beer. Asheville. May 14th. Seventeen words. That's the filing.

## 2. EVIL TWIN BREWING - "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Flavored Malt Beverage
- Company: Evil Twin Brewing
- Approved: 12/30/2025

Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." Twenty-two words. That's five more than the Burial Beer one. We're in an arms race now. I'm keeping score. Nobody asked me to.

**Post 2:**
"The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit." That's either a beer name or a manifesto. Evil Twin filed it December 30th. The TTB approved it. I think they're making fun of themselves. Or the industry. Or me specifically. Unclear.

**Post 3:**
Evil Twin named a beer after what every craft brewery has been doing for five years. They just said it out loud. In a TTB filing. To the federal government. Filed December 30th. First approval of 2026, probably. Someone had to start the new year with that one.

Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

Twenty-two words. Longer than the Burial Beer name by five. I'm keeping track now. Of word counts in beer names. This is what happens when you look at 1.6 million label filings. You start counting things that don't need to be counted.

Speaking of which. And I don't know why this came to mind. I had a professor in college who said all satire becomes reality within ten years. He was talking about politics, I think. He died before Instagram existed. But I think about him sometimes when I see beer names like this. The lactose. The fruit purees. The marketing language. Evil Twin put it all in the product name. Like a confession. Or a time capsule.

But that's not the point. The point is: twenty-two words. December 30th. Flavored malt beverage. Filed with the federal government. Approved. We all just have to live with that now.

**Post 2:**
December 30th, 2025. Last business day of the year, probably. Someone at Evil Twin submitted a label application. The product name: "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

Twenty-two words. A period in the middle. "Luxurious Treatment" at the end, like an afterthought. Or a warning.

Hold on. I just remembered something. Years ago, and I don't know why I'm thinking about this, someone asked me what the longest beer name in the database was. I didn't know. I still don't know. I should probably check. I'm not going to check. That seems like the kind of thing that would take a while and lead to more questions.

Point is. Evil Twin. Twenty-two words. They're either satirizing the industry or participating in it. Maybe both. The TTB doesn't distinguish between irony and sincerity. They just approve labels. December 30th. That's the filing.

## 3. SELDOM SEEN WHISKEY COMPANY - "Seldom Seen"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Rye Whisky
- Company: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company
- Signal: NEW_COMPANY (first-time filer)
- Approved: 01/02/2026

### X Posts

**Post 1:**
A company called Seldom Seen Whiskey filed their first label with the TTB. It is a rye. They were unknown until this week. Now they're in my database. And this post. So they're not seldom seen anymore. I've ruined it for them. That wasn't my intention.

**Post 2:**
Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First-ever TTB filing. Rye whisky. The name is either very optimistic or very pessimistic depending on how you read it. I'm not going to speculate. January 2nd, 2026. They exist now, officially.

**Post 3:**
New company in the database: Seldom Seen Whiskey. First filing. Rye. The name suggests scarcity. Which is either a marketing strategy or an honest assessment of their distribution. I have no way of knowing which. Good luck to them.

**Post 1:**
Every established whiskey brand was once a first-time filer. Maker's Mark. Buffalo Trace. Wild Turkey. Someone submitted paperwork, and it got approved, and then they existed in the eyes of the federal government.

On January 2nd, 2026, a new company joined the list: Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. Rye whisky. First filing.

Let me tell you something. I've watched a lot of first-time filers come through this database. Most of them I never hear about again. Some of them become real companies. Some of them don't. The filing doesn't tell you which. Just that someone, somewhere, believed in this enough to fill out the paperwork.

The name is interesting. "Seldom Seen." Could mean rare. Exclusive. Hard to find. Could also mean nobody's buying it. Marketing is complicated. Names carry weight. This one cuts both ways.

I don't know anything else about them. The database doesn't tell me much. Just the company name, the product, the date. Everything else is someone else's story. January 2nd. Rye whisky. Seldom Seen. We'll see how that holds up.

**Post 2:**
Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First TTB filing. January 2nd, 2026.

I had a thought about this one. Bear with me.

My neighbor makes furniture in his garage. Has for twenty years. Never sold a piece. Just makes them. Gives them away sometimes. His wife asked him once why he doesn't open a shop. He said if he opened a shop, he'd have to make furniture people wanted instead of furniture he wanted. That was the end of the conversation.

I don't know why I thought of that. Something about the name, probably. "Seldom Seen." Maybe they want to be found. Maybe they don't. The TTB filing doesn't tell you intent. Just that someone filed paperwork for a rye whisky from a company that didn't exist in the database before this week.

They exist now. In my database. And this post. I've seen them. So have you. Whether that changes things for them or not, I don't know. That's neither here nor there.

## 4. DSSOLVR - "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Specialty Beer
- Company: DSSOLVR (Asheville, NC)
- Approved: 12/23/2025

### X Posts

**Post 1:**
"Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" is not a menu item. It is a beer. DSSOLVR filed it with the TTB. The TTB approved it. I have questions. I'm not going to ask them. Asheville, North Carolina. December 23rd. Two days before Christmas.

**Post 2:**
Someone made a beer called Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza. I don't know what cold means in this context. I don't know what caprese means in this context. I don't know what pizza means in this context. The TTB approved it anyway. DSSOLVR. Asheville. Specialty beer.

**Post 3:**
There's a beer called Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza. I have several questions. None of them are going to be answered by the TTB filing, which just says: DSSOLVR, specialty beer, approved December 23rd, Asheville. That's all I get. That's all any of us get.

DSSOLVR filed a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

I'm going to need a moment.

Okay sidebar. I once had a coworker who ate the same lunch every day. Turkey sandwich, apple, water. Every day. For three years. I asked him why once. He said decisions are exhausting. He didn't want to think about lunch. He wanted to think about other things. He was an accountant. I don't know what other things he was thinking about. That was fifteen years ago. I still think about him sometimes when I see something like this. Someone who looked at the infinite possibilities of beer naming and said: you know what, pizza.

Where was I. Right. DSSOLVR. Asheville. December 23rd. Two days before Christmas. Someone at the TTB read "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" and approved it and then, I assume, went to a holiday party. Or didn't. I don't know their schedule.

It's a specialty beer. That's the category. I don't know if it tastes like pizza. I don't know if that's the point. Some things you just accept and move on.

**Post 2:**
"Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

That's a beer name. DSSOLVR filed it with the federal government. The federal government approved it. December 23rd, 2025.

I'm going to go on a tangent here. Bear with me.

I grew up in the Midwest. In the Midwest, pizza is pizza. It has cheese. It has sauce. Sometimes pepperoni. You don't ask questions about pizza. You eat it. It's Wednesday night and nobody wants to cook. That's pizza.

A caprese salad is different. That's tomatoes and mozzarella and basil. That's what you order when you're at a restaurant trying to impress someone. Or you're not that hungry. Or both.

I don't know how these two things relate to beer. I don't know how fresh hops fit in. I don't know what "cold" is modifying in that sentence. The caprese? The pizza? The temperature at which existential confusion sets in when reading a beer name?

None of that matters. The TTB approved it. Asheville. Specialty beer. That's the filing. I don't have analysis. I just have facts.

## 5. AURELIAN RESERVE (Bespoken Spirits) - "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference"

**Filing Details:**
- Category: Whisky
- Company: Bespoken Spirits
- Approved: 12/19/2025

### X Posts

**Post 1:**
There is now a whiskey for the Atlantic 10 Conference. The basketball conference. I don't know if Dayton fans needed this. I'm not going to speculate. Bespoken Spirits. Aurelian Reserve. Fifty years of mid-major basketball. Now in whisky form.

**Post 2:**
Someone pitched "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference" as a whisky and someone else said yes. And then someone at the TTB approved it. That's three people minimum who thought this was a good idea. December 19th. It's real now.

**Post 3:**
Aurelian Reserve filed a whisky for the A-10. The college basketball conference. I didn't know conference-branded whisky was a category. Maybe it isn't. Maybe this is the first one. I'm not going to look it up. Bespoken Spirits. December 19th.

### LinkedIn Posts

**Post 1:**
There's a whisky now for the Atlantic 10 Conference. The college basketball conference. Dayton. VCU. Saint Louis. Schools like that.

I didn't know this was a category. Conference-branded whisky. I looked it up. It might be the first one. Or maybe it isn't. I didn't look that hard.

You know what this reminds me of? Years ago, and I don't know why I'm thinking about this, I went to a minor league baseball game. They were selling branded hot sauce. For the team. Minor league baseball hot sauce. I bought one. Brought it home. Never opened it. It's still in my pantry. Expired in 2019. I keep it because throwing it away feels wrong somehow.

But I digress. Aurelian Reserve. Bespoken Spirits. Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball, commemorated in whisky form. December 19th. Someone at a marketing agency pitched this. Someone else agreed. That's how things become real. Someone says something. Someone else says yes. Then it exists.

I don't have a take on this. I just noticed it. Make of it what you will.

**Post 2:**
The Atlantic 10 Conference has a whisky now.

Okay. Let me try to explain this. The Atlantic 10 is a college basketball conference. It's what they call a mid-major. Not the big schools. The medium schools. The schools that occasionally make the NCAA tournament and upset someone you've heard of.

Bespoken Spirits filed a whisky for the conference's 50th anniversary. Brand name: Aurelian Reserve. Approved December 19th.

Not related, but I went to a college with a bad basketball team. We won maybe four games a year. Nobody made commemorative whisky for us. I think about that sometimes. Not in a bitter way. Just in a factual way. Some conferences get whisky. Some don't. That's how it works.

Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball. VCU made the Final Four in 2011. I remember that. Other than that, I'm drawing a blank. The whisky might help. Or it might not. I don't know what the whisky is for, exactly. Celebrating, presumably. Commemorating. Whatever it is you do with commemorative whisky.

That's the filing. I don't know what else to tell you.

## HONORABLE MENTIONS

### YAO FAMILY WINES - Yao Ming's Wine Label

**X Post:**
Yao Ming has a wine label. The basketball player. Seven foot six. Now he makes wine. Retired from basketball, started a winery. That's the dream, I suppose. Play professional sports, then make wine. I didn't play professional sports. I made a database. We all end up somewhere.

**LinkedIn Post:**
Yao Ming has a wine label. Yao Family Wines. The basketball player. Seven foot six. Played for the Rockets. Now he's in the wine business.

I think about this sometimes. Athletes retiring and buying vineyards. It happens more than you'd think. Something about wine, I guess. It seems like the kind of thing a retired athlete would do. Peaceful. Respectable. Good weather.

My buddy from college wanted to open a brewery when he retired. He's an accountant. He's not going to retire for another twenty years. By then he probably won't want to open a brewery anymore. That's how dreams work sometimes. You have them until you don't.

Anyway. Yao Ming. Wine. It's in the database. I track these things.

### GHOST FACE VODKA - Wu-Tang Themed Vodka

**X Post:**
There's a vodka called Ghost Face now. Like the Wu-Tang member. Or the Scream mask. Probably the Wu-Tang member. Manifest Distilling. December 2025. Wu-Tang is forever, apparently. So are the licensing deals.

---

### PICKLE SHINE - Pickle-Flavored Moonshine

**X Post:**
So there's a pickle moonshine now. "Pickle Shine." Madhatter Distillery. I've seen three pickle-flavored spirits this month. Different companies. Different states. I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying three. The pickle-industrial complex is real and it's coming for your liquor cabinet.

---

### YEAR OF THE HORSE - Luzhou Laojiao Baijiu

**X Post:**
Luzhou Laojiao filed a "Year of the Horse" baijiu. Chinese New Year planning. 2026 is the Snake, I think. So this is either for 2027 or someone got the zodiac wrong. I'm not going to investigate. It's in the database. Someone will figure it out.

---

### Combined Honorable Mentions (LinkedIn)

A few other filings that caught my eye this week:

Yao Ming's wine label filed another product. The basketball player turned winemaker. Seven foot six, now making Cabernet. Athletes and wine. There's something there. I don't know what.

There's a vodka called Ghost Face now. From Manifest Distilling. Like the Wu-Tang member. Or the Scream mask. The TTB doesn't require you to cite your cultural references. You just file the paperwork and hope nobody sues.

Pickle Shine. That's pickle-flavored moonshine. From Madhatter Distillery. This is the third pickle-flavored spirit I've seen this month. Different companies. Different states. No coordination that I know of. Sometimes trends happen that way. Nobody's in charge. Everyone just decides pickles are the thing now. It's probably nothing.

And someone filed a "Year of the Horse" baijiu for Chinese New Year. Premium Chinese spirit. Limited edition. Except 2026 is the Year of the Snake, I think. Maybe this is for 2027. Maybe someone got the calendar wrong. These things happen. The TTB approved it either way.

1.6 million filings in the database. These are just a few of them. Most filings are normal. "Reserve." "Select." "Limited Edition." Then you get seventeen-word existential beer names and conference-branded whisky and pickle moonshine. I write about those ones. The normal ones I don't mention. That's the whole job, really. Finding the ones worth mentioning.
