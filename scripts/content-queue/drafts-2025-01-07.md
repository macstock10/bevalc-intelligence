## 1. BURIAL BEER CO. - "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness"

**Context:** Flavored Malt Beverage - Asheville, NC - Approved 05/14/2025

### X Post 1

Someone at Burial Beer Co. named a beer "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Seventeen words. I counted. Someone at the TTB had to type all seventeen of those words into a federal database. That person is a government employee. They probably make $58,000 a year. I don't know why I'm thinking about their salary. Anyway, it's from Asheville.

### X Post 2

Burial Beer filed a flavored malt beverage with the federal government. The name of the beverage is "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." I don't know if that's the name of the beer or a cry for help. The TTB approved it either way. They approve most things. May 14th. Asheville. That's the whole story.

### X Post 3

A beer got approved in May. The name is "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." I feel for the compliance officer. Seventeen words. All spelled correctly. Someone checked the spelling on "Unabashedly." That's professionalism. Or exhaustion. Hard to tell the difference sometimes.

### LinkedIn Post 1

A company called Burial Beer Co. filed a label with the federal government last May. The product is a flavored malt beverage. The name of the product is "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

That is seventeen words. I counted them. Then I counted them again because I thought maybe I miscounted. I did not. Seventeen.

Someone at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau had to read this name. Then type it. Then approve it. Those are three separate steps. All performed by someone who went home afterward and probably didn't think about it again. Or maybe they did. The database doesn't tell me what people think. Just what they file.

This has nothing to do with anything, but my father used to say the best beer names were three words or less. He said anything more than that was showing off. He drank Schlitz. He died in 2008. Never saw a seventeen-word beer name. Probably for the best.

Anyway. Asheville. May 14th. Flavored malt beverage. That's the filing.

### LinkedIn Post 2

I think about the TTB sometimes. More than I should, probably.

There's an office somewhere. Federal building. Someone sits at a desk and reviews label applications. "Miller Lite." Approved. "Bud Light." Approved. "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

Pause.

I like to think they paused. I like to think there's a moment where someone at the TTB reads something like this and looks out the window. Maybe thinks about their own dreams. Whether they're mundane. Whether they're meaningful. Then they type it into the database and move on to the next one. "Coors Light." Approved.

Do they have a group chat where they share the weird ones. I hope so. I like to think there's a guy named Doug who texts his wife about these. "Honey, you won't believe what came across my desk today." Maybe her name isn't Karen. I don't know these people.

Anyway. 1,247 labels got approved that week. Someone processed every one of them. Thank you, whoever you are. I built a database on your work. I hope that's okay.

## 2. EVIL TWIN BREWING - "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

**Context:** Flavored Malt Beverage - Approved 12/30/2025

### X Post 1

Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." Twenty-two words. That's longer than the Burial Beer one by five words. We're in an arms race now. I'm keeping track. Nobody asked me to.

### X Post 2

"The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." This is not a manifesto. It is a beer name. Evil Twin filed it. The TTB approved it. December 30th. Last business day of the year, basically. Someone wanted to get this in under the wire. Mission accomplished, I guess.

### X Post 3

Evil Twin Brewing is either making fun of the industry or themselves or me specifically. I can't tell. The beer is called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." The period after "Fruit" is doing a lot of work. "Luxurious Treatment" is its own sentence. A conclusion. Or a warning. Hard to say.

### LinkedIn Post 1

There's a beer now called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

I read that sentence three times. It doesn't get shorter.

Twenty-two words. The period after "Fruit" is interesting. Creates a pause. Like the name has two parts. An observation. Then a judgment. "The future is here, and it's full of lactose and fruit." Pause. "Luxurious Treatment." I don't know if that's sarcasm. The TTB doesn't track sarcasm. Just filings.

Speaking of which. And I don't know why this came to mind. I used to know a guy who worked in marketing. Beverage marketing. He said the secret was to say what everyone was thinking but louder. I asked what that meant. He said it meant nothing. That was the last conversation we had. He works in insurance now, I think. Or real estate. One of those.

Anyway. Evil Twin. December 30th. Flavored malt beverage. Twenty-two words. That's five more than the Burial Beer one. We're setting records here. Nobody asked for these records. But here they are.

### LinkedIn Post 2

December 30th, 2025. Last business day of the year.

Someone at Evil Twin submitted a label application. Twenty-two words. A period in the middle. "Luxurious Treatment" at the end, like an afterthought.

I was going to say something about this but I forgot what. Here it is anyway.

The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment.

I've been looking at beer names for a while now. 1.6 million labels in the database. Most of them are normal. "Reserve." "Select." "Platinum." Things like that. Then you get this one and the Burial Beer one and you start to wonder if something is happening. A trend. A movement. Breweries naming beers after existential observations. I don't know what to call it. I'm not going to try.

The TTB approved it. They approve most things. That's their job. Someone filed paperwork. Someone else said yes. Then it's real. That's how things happen. Always has been.

## 3. SELDOM SEEN WHISKEY COMPANY - "Seldom Seen"

**Context:** Rye Whisky - NEW_COMPANY - Approved 01/02/2026

### X Post 1

New company filed their first label this week. They're called Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. The whiskey is called Seldom Seen. It's a rye. Before January 2nd, they were completely unknown. Now they're in my database. And this post. So they're not seldom seen anymore. I've ruined it for them. Sorry.

### X Post 2

Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First-ever TTB filing. Rye whisky. The name is either very optimistic or very pessimistic depending on how you read it. I've been thinking about it for three days. I have not decided which. I'll let you know. Or I won't. We'll see.

### X Post 3

A company called Seldom Seen Whiskey filed their first label on January 2nd. New company. First business day of the year. Rye whiskey. The name is Seldom Seen. I don't know if that's the goal or the fear. Maybe it's both. Anyway, they exist now. In the eyes of the federal government, at least.

### LinkedIn Post 1

Seldom Seen Whiskey Company filed their first label last week. January 2nd, 2026. First business day of the year. They came out swinging.

The product is a rye whisky. The name is also Seldom Seen. Which is either very confident or very honest. Time will tell.

Let me tell you something. I've watched a lot of first-time filers come through this database. 1.6 million records. Most of the new companies, I never hear about again. They file the paperwork. They get the approval. Then... I don't know. Some of them end up in liquor stores. Some of them don't. The database doesn't track what happens after. Just that they existed, once, in the eyes of the federal government.

Every big whiskey brand was a first-time filer once. Buffalo Trace. Maker's Mark. Wild Turkey. Someone filled out the paperwork. Someone else approved it. Then they became something.

Seldom Seen. We'll see how that ages.

### LinkedIn Post 2

Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First filing. Rye whisky. January 2nd, 2026.

I had a thought about this one.

My neighbor used to make furniture in his garage. Twenty years he did this. Never sold a piece. Just made them. Gave them away sometimes. His wife asked him once why he didn't open a shop. He said if he opened a shop, he'd have to make furniture people wanted instead of furniture he wanted to make. That was the end of the conversation. He died in 2019. Heart attack. We weren't close or anything. I just knew him.

I don't know why I thought of that. Something about the name, probably. "Seldom Seen." Maybe they want to be found. Maybe they don't. The TTB doesn't ask about intent. Just product name, company name, date of approval. That's it.

They exist now. In my database. And this post. I've seen them. So have you. Whether that changes things for them or not, I have no idea. That's neither here nor there.

## 4. DSSOLVR - "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza"

**Context:** Specialty Beer - Asheville, NC - Approved 12/23/2025

### X Post 1

There's a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." I have questions. I'm not going to ask them. Some things you just accept. TTB approved it. Asheville. Specialty beer. December 23rd. Two days before Christmas. That's all the information I have. That's all any of us have.

### X Post 2

DSSOLVR made a beer. The beer is called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." I don't know if it tastes like pizza. I don't know if it should. I don't know who asked for this. Someone did, apparently. The TTB approved it. We all just have to live with that now.

### X Post 3

Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza. That's a beer now. From Asheville. I've been looking at alcohol labels for a long time. This is one of them. DSSOLVR filed it. I don't know how to pronounce DSSOLVR. I'm not going to try. The TTB said yes. So here we are.

### LinkedIn Post 1

DSSOLVR filed a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

I'm going to need a moment.

Okay. Sidebar. I once worked with a guy who ate the same lunch every day. Turkey sandwich. Apple. Water. Every day. For three years. I asked him why once, at a company thing. He said decisions are exhausting. He said he didn't want to think about lunch. He wanted to think about other things. He was an accountant. I don't know what other things he was thinking about. He quit in 2017. Moved to Arizona. Or New Mexico. One of the dry ones. I still think about him sometimes when I see something like this. Someone who looked at the infinite possibilities of beer naming and said: you know what, pizza.

Where was I. Right. DSSOLVR. Asheville. December 23rd. Two days before Christmas. Someone at the TTB read "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza" and approved it and then, I assume, left early for the holidays. Or maybe they didn't. I don't know their schedule.

Specialty beer. That's the category. I don't know if it tastes like pizza. I don't know if that's the point. Some things you just accept and move on.

### LinkedIn Post 2

"Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

That's a beer name. Not a menu item. A beer name. DSSOLVR filed it with the federal government. The federal government said okay. December 23rd, 2025.

This is off topic, but. I grew up in the Midwest. In the Midwest, pizza is pizza. It has cheese. It has sauce. Sometimes pepperoni. You don't ask questions about pizza. You just eat it. It's Wednesday night and nobody wants to cook. That's pizza.

A caprese salad is different. That's tomatoes and mozzarella and basil. That's what you order when you're at a restaurant and you're not that hungry. Or you're trying to seem healthy. Same thing.

I don't know how these two things combined with hops to become a beer. The TTB doesn't require an explanation. Just a name and a form. Someone filled out the form. Someone else approved it.

DSSOLVR. Asheville. Specialty beer. That's the filing. I don't have analysis. Just facts. Make of them what you will.

## 5. AURELIAN RESERVE (Bespoken Spirits) - "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference"

**Context:** Whisky - Approved 12/19/2025

### X Post 1

There's a whiskey now for the Atlantic 10 Conference. The basketball conference. Not the ACC. Not the Big Ten. The Atlantic 10. Dayton. VCU. Schools like that. Someone at a marketing agency pitched this. And someone else said yes. And now it's in a government database. That's how things happen.

### X Post 2

Someone made a whiskey to celebrate fifty years of the Atlantic 10 Conference. I didn't know conference-branded whisky was a category. Maybe it isn't. Maybe this is the first one. I'm not going to look it up. Bespoken Spirits. Aurelian Reserve. December 19th.

### X Post 3

Aurelian Reserve filed a whisky called "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference." It exists. I looked it up. The A-10 has existed for 50 years. That part checks out. Whether it needed a commemorative whiskey is a different question. One I'm not qualified to answer. But there it is.

### LinkedIn Post 1

There's a whisky now for the Atlantic 10 Conference. The college basketball conference. Fifty years old, apparently.

I didn't know this was a category. Conference-branded whisky. I looked to see if there were others. I didn't find any. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Maybe this is the first one. I don't know.

You know what this reminds me of. Years ago, and I don't know why I'm thinking about this, I went to a minor league baseball game. They were selling branded hot sauce. For the team. Minor league baseball hot sauce. I bought one. Brought it home. Never opened it. It's still in my pantry. Expired in 2019. I keep it because throwing it away feels wrong somehow. I don't know why.

But I digress. Aurelian Reserve. Bespoken Spirits. Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball, commemorated in whisky form. December 19th. Someone at a marketing agency said "what if we made a whisky for mid-major basketball fans." Someone else said yes. That's how things become real. Someone says something. Someone else agrees. Then it exists.

I don't have a take on this. I just noticed it. Make of it what you will.

### LinkedIn Post 2

The Atlantic 10 Conference has a whisky now.

Let me try to explain this. The Atlantic 10 is a college basketball conference. It's what they call a mid-major. Not the big schools. The medium schools. The schools that occasionally make the NCAA tournament and upset someone you've heard of.

Bespoken Spirits filed a whisky for the conference's 50th anniversary. Brand name: Aurelian Reserve. Approved December 19th.

Not related, but. I went to a college with a bad basketball team. We won maybe four games a year. We were not in a major conference. Or a mid-major conference. We were in a conference I don't think exists anymore. Nobody made commemorative whisky for us. That's neither here nor there.

Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball. VCU made the Final Four in 2011. I remember that. Butler made it a couple times. Other than that, I'm drawing a blank. The whisky might help jog some memories. Or it might not. I don't know what commemorative whisky is for, exactly. Celebrating, presumably. Commemorating. Whatever it is people do with commemorative things.

That's the filing. I don't know what else to tell you.

## HONORABLE MENTIONS

### YAO FAMILY WINES - Yao Ming's Wine Label

**X Post**

Yao Ming has a wine label. The basketball player. 7'6". First overall pick, 2002. Now he makes wine. That's the path, I guess. Play professional sports, get famous, start a winery. I didn't play professional sports. I made a database. We all end up somewhere.

**LinkedIn Post**

Yao Ming has been filing wine labels for years now. The basketball player. Retired in 2011. Started making wine.

I don't know if it's good. The database doesn't track quality. Just that it exists, and when it was approved, and what it's called.

YAO FAMILY WINES. Napa, presumably. Where else would a retired NBA star make wine. Everyone ends up in Napa eventually. Or so it seems from the filings.

He was 7'6". Now he tends grapes. I assume he tends grapes. Maybe he just signs things and other people tend the grapes. The TTB filing doesn't say. Just company name, product name, date. That's all I get.

---

### GHOST FACE VODKA - Wu-Tang Themed

**X Post**

There's a vodka called Ghost Face now. Wu-Tang themed, I assume. Unless there's another Ghost Face. There might be. I didn't look that hard. The database says what people file, not why. Anyway. Ghost Face Vodka. It exists.

---

### PICKLE SHINE - Pickle-Flavored Moonshine

**X Post**

Pickle Shine. That's a pickle-flavored moonshine. Someone made it. Someone else approved it. This is the third pickle-flavored spirit I've seen this month. Different companies. Different states. I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying three. The pickle industrial complex is real and it's coming for your liquor cabinet.

**LinkedIn Post**

Three pickle-flavored spirits got approved this month. Unrelated companies. Different states. No coordination that I know of.

Pickle Shine is one of them. Moonshine. Pickle-flavored. From Madhatter Distillery.

I don't know why pickles became a spirit flavor. I'm not going to speculate. Some trends you just observe. You don't have to understand them. Maybe that's the point. Maybe there is no point.

1.6 million labels in the database. Three of them are pickle-flavored spirits filed this month. That's statistically nothing. But it's also three more than I would have expected. So there's that.

### YEAR OF THE HORSE - Luzhou Laojiao Baijiu

**X Post**

There's a baijiu now. Year of the Horse. Luzhou Laojiao. That's a Chinese distillery. One of the oldest. 500 years or something. Now they're filing with the TTB. Chinese zodiac themed. 2026 is the Snake, I think. So this might be for 2027. Or someone got the calendar wrong. Anyway. Baijiu. Horse. Government paperwork. That's the update.
