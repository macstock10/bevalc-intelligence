## 1. BURIAL BEER CO. - "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness"

**Context:** Flavored Malt Beverage - Asheville, NC - Approved 05/14/2025

### X Post 1 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

TTB approved a beer called "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Seventeen words. I counted. Someone at the TTB had to type that into a database. On a Wednesday. At 2:47 PM. In a beige office. Building 4, I believe. Near the vending machines. The ones with the Snickers. Fifty cents. Per bar. I don't know any of this for certain. Anyway it's from Asheville.

### X Post 2 (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

Burial Beer is a well-regarded brewery. Very creative. Award-winning, probably. People say nice things about them on the internet. I read some of them once. Now they've filed a beer called "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." I'm not saying they're pretentious. I'm just saying seventeen words. And none of them are "beer." Or "ale." Or anything that tells you what's in the can. I'm not saying anything. I said it anyway.

### X Post 3 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

I tried to memorize this beer name. Burial Beer. "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Got to "unabashedly" and forgot everything after. Tried again. Forgot "mundane." Third time. Wrote it wrong. A different wrong. I've now spent more time on this name than I spent on anything of value in my life. Which is saying something. Not something good. But something.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE ESCALATING LIST WITH NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT)

A guy emailed me once about beer names. He said the best ones were three words or less. "Budweiser." One word. "Miller Lite." Two words. "Pabst Blue Ribbon." Three words. Perfect.

He also said his wife left him that year. And his dog died. And he moved to a smaller apartment. In Toledo. Near a sandwich shop that closed in 2019.

Next line.

He asked if I had any job openings.

Next line.

I did not.

Anyway, Burial Beer filed a product with the TTB. The name is "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness." Seventeen words. My correspondent would not have approved. He's in insurance now. Or real estate. One of those. Toledo still. The sandwich shop is a laundromat now.

### LinkedIn Post 2 (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)

Someone at the TTB had to type this into a database. "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane And The Rest Are Contrived Compositions of Meaninglessness."

Seventeen words. All spelled correctly. In a government office. Probably Building 4. Or Building 6. One of the buildings.

Then they went home. Ate dinner. Watched television. Went to bed. Woke up. Came back. Typed more names into the database. That's the job. Every day. Names into databases. Some of them three words. Some of them seventeen. Some of them about existential dread. Most of them about whiskey.

It's better than some jobs. War correspondent. Hospice nurse. The other ones. So there's that. Anyway. Asheville. May 14th. Flavored malt beverage. That's the filing.

## 2. EVIL TWIN BREWING - "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

**Context:** Flavored Malt Beverage - Approved 12/30/2025

### X Post 1 (THE REFUSAL TO BE CORRECTED)

Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." Someone said that's actually two sentences. I said I don't think so. They said look at the period. I said the period is decorative. They said periods aren't decorative. I said this one is. They said I was counting wrong. I said twenty-two words. They left.

### X Post 2 (THE CALLBACK THAT MAKES NO SENSE)

Remember the Burial Beer one. Seventeen words. "Most of My Dreams Are Unabashedly Mundane." And so forth. Well. Evil Twin filed one with twenty-two words. "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment." We're in an arms race now. Someone will file a novel next. And you know who the real victim is here. Frank Stallone.

### X Post 3 (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)

The beer industry has changed. There was a time. Hops. Barley. Water. The usual stuff. Normal stuff. Now there's milk sugar. And fruit. Three varieties of fruit. And whatever "Luxurious Treatment" means.

Evil Twin filed it. The TTB approved it. We all have to live with this now. It's better than some things. The 20th century had two world wars. We have lactose beer. I'll take it. That's progress. Or something like progress. Close enough.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

Evil Twin filed a beer called "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

I think they're making a point. About trends. About lactose. About the general direction of craft beer. Or maybe they're not making a point. Maybe they just wanted to name a beer this. Maybe there is no point.

Is it funny. Maybe. Is it commentary. Could be. Is it meaningful. I don't know. But what then. I don't know that either. But is it a beer. Yes. It's in the database. December 30th. Last business day of the year. Someone filed it. Someone approved it. Now it exists.

I don't have a conclusion. That's the conclusion. There is no conclusion. Twenty-two words and no conclusion.

### LinkedIn Post 2 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

December 30th, 2025. 4:47 PM. A government employee sits at a desk. Desk number 14. Row C. Near the window. The window faces east. There's a parking lot. A 2019 Honda Civic. Gray. Someone's. Not the employee's. The employee takes the bus. Line 42. Gets off at Franklin.

The application comes through. "The Future Is Here And Everything Must Contain Extra Milk Sugar And Three Varieties of Fruit. Luxurious Treatment."

The employee reads it. Counts the words. Loses count at fifteen. Starts over. Gets twenty-two. Or twenty-three. Hard to tell with the period. Approves it anyway. Logs off. Takes the bus home. Line 42. Gets off at Franklin. Walks four blocks. Apartment 3B. Microwave dinner. Salisbury steak. Watches Wheel of Fortune. Goes to bed at 10:15.

I don't know any of this. I made it up. The beer is real though. That part I can verify.

## 3. SELDOM SEEN WHISKEY COMPANY - "Seldom Seen"

**Context:** Rye Whisky - NEW_COMPANY - Approved 01/02/2026

### X Post 1 (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

New company alert. Seldom Seen Whiskey. First filing ever. Very mysterious. Very underground. Completely unknown before January 2nd. I had never heard of them. Nobody had. That was the whole point, I think. The name. Seldom Seen.

Now they're in my database. And this post. And probably your feed. I've seen them. You've seen them. We've all seen them now.

So I've ruined it. Their whole thing. The mystery. Gone. My fault. Sorry about that. Should have kept quiet. Didn't.

### X Post 2 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

I spent forty minutes trying to find information about Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. Googled them. Nothing. LinkedIn. Nothing. Instagram. Nothing. Whiskey forums. Nothing. Reddit. Nothing.

They are, in fact, seldom seen. Which is either excellent marketing or I'm bad at Google. Both are possible. I'm bad at most things. The Google thing wouldn't surprise me. Rye whiskey. New company. January 2nd. That's all I've got.

### X Post 3 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First TTB filing. January 2nd, 2026. A Thursday. 9:47 AM Eastern. Or maybe Pacific. The database doesn't specify. Building 4, presumably. Near the vending machines.

Someone started a whiskey company on the first business day of the year. That's either very optimistic or very pessimistic. The rye is also called "Seldom Seen." They didn't overcomplicate things. Name of company. Name of whiskey. Same words. Four dollars saved on branding. Per word. I assume. I don't know what branding costs.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE ESCALATING LIST WITH NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT)

My father gave me advice once. About business. He sat me down. This was 1987. Maybe 1988. The kitchen. Yellow wallpaper. A Wednesday.

He said, "Son, I want to tell you something important."

I said, "What is it, Dad."

He said, "If you're going to start a business, make sure people can find you."

Next line.

He also said he was leaving my mother.

Next line.

And that he'd lost the house in a poker game.

Next line.

And that he'd see me at Christmas. He didn't. He moved to Nevada. Died in 2003. Heart attack. We weren't close by then.

Anyway, there's a new company called Seldom Seen Whiskey. They filed their first label last week. Rye whisky. Also called "Seldom Seen." My father would have had thoughts about that name. Visibility. Findability. He had a lot of thoughts. About most things. The poker game was a bad thought. The other stuff too. But that's neither here nor there.

### LinkedIn Post 2 (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

Seldom Seen Whiskey Company. First filing. January 2nd. Rye whisky.

I tried to figure out what to say about this. I thought about it for a while. A long while. Too long, probably.

Is the name good. I don't know. Is it bad. Also don't know. Is it clever. Maybe. Is it too clever. Could be. Will they be successful. Can't say. Will anyone remember them in five years. No idea.

The database has 1.6 million records. Most of the companies, I never hear about again. They file. They exist. Then they don't. Or they do. The database doesn't tell you what happens after. Just that someone filled out the paperwork. And someone else said yes.

Seldom Seen. First filing. Rye whisky. New company.

That's the update. I don't have analysis. I don't have predictions. I don't have a take. Just the facts. Make of them what you will. Or don't. Either way.

## 4. DSSOLVR - "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza"

**Context:** Specialty Beer - Asheville, NC - Approved 12/23/2025

### X Post 1 (THE REFUSAL TO BE CORRECTED)

Someone told me DSSOLVR is pronounced "dissolver." I said that can't be right. They said it is right. I said where are the vowels. They said you add them. I said then it's a different word. They said no it's the same word without vowels. I said I don't think that's how words work. They said I was wrong. I said well. Anyway they made a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza."

### X Post 2 (THE ESCALATING LIST WITH NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT)

DSSOLVR filed a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." It contains hops. It references pizza. It was approved December 23rd. Two days before Christmas. Someone at the TTB typed "Caprese Pizza" into a federal database. Then they went home. Wrapped presents. Attended a party. Got engaged. Got unengaged. Moved to Phoenix. Opened a bakery. Closed the bakery. Went back to the TTB. Different building. Same vending machines. The beer is from Asheville. That's irrelevant to the rest.

### X Post 3 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

I don't understand this beer. "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." DSSOLVR made it. TTB approved it. Asheville.

I tried to figure out what caprese pizza has to do with beer. Couldn't. Tried to figure out what "cold" adds to the name. Couldn't. Tried to pronounce the brewery name. Couldn't. Gave up on all three.

Some things are beyond understanding. This might be one of them. Or it might make perfect sense and I'm missing it. Both options equally likely. I've been wrong before. About most things.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS + SHAGGY DOG)

Speaking of which. And I don't know why this came to mind.

I used to know a guy who only ate pizza. Every meal. Breakfast pizza. Lunch pizza. Dinner pizza. Cold pizza mostly. From the box. Day-old.

We worked together in 2014. Or 2015. One of those. He was in accounting. Or HR. Something with letters. I asked him once why only pizza. He said he tried other foods. They disappointed him. Pizza never disappointed him. That was the whole explanation.

He left the company in 2016. Heart thing. Or it wasn't a heart thing. I heard different stories. The point is he's not here anymore. Not dead. Just not here. Florida maybe. Or nowhere. Hard to track people.

Anyway. DSSOLVR filed a beer called "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." From Asheville. December 23rd. Two days before Christmas. I thought of the pizza guy when I saw it. I don't know why. Caprese isn't really pizza. It's tomatoes and mozzarella. On a plate. Sometimes basil. Different thing entirely.

But that's neither here nor there. The beer exists. Specialty category. I haven't tried it. Won't. Not a beer person. Just a database person. Different thing entirely.

### LinkedIn Post 2 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

December 23rd, 2025. 2:15 PM. Two days before Christmas. Building 4. Row C. Desk 14. Near the vending machines. The ones with the Snickers. Fifty cents. Per bar. And the Doritos. Seventy-five cents. Per bag. Cool Ranch. Nobody buys the Nacho Cheese. That's relevant somehow. Or it isn't.

The application comes through. "Fresh Hop Cold Caprese Pizza." Specialty beer. From DSSOLVR. Which is pronounced "dissolver." Or it isn't. I've heard both.

The employee reads it. Pauses. Thinks about pizza. Thinks about beer. Thinks about whether they ordered the right thing for Christmas dinner. They didn't. They know that now. Too late to change it. Ham. Should have been turkey. Or prime rib. One of those.

Approves the beer. Logs off early. It's 2:47 PM. Close enough to 5:00. No one's counting. Drives home. Stops at the grocery store. Changes the ham to turkey. Or tries to. They're out of turkey. Ham it is. Merry Christmas. Asheville. That's the filing.

## 5. AURELIAN RESERVE (Bespoken Spirits) - "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference"

**Context:** Whisky - Approved 12/19/2025

### X Post 1 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

There's a whiskey now for the Atlantic 10 Conference. The basketball conference. Fiftieth anniversary. I tried to name all the teams. Got to six. Guessed two more. Both wrong. Looked it up. There are fifteen teams now. Called the Atlantic 10. Fifteen teams. I don't understand college sports. Never have. The whiskey was approved December 19th. Bespoken Spirits. I don't have more information. I don't have less either.

### X Post 2 (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

The Atlantic 10 is a fine conference. Good basketball. Competitive. Davidson made a run once. Or twice. George Mason had that thing in 2006. Respectable programs.

Now they have a commemorative whiskey. Fiftieth anniversary. Aurelian Reserve. Bespoken Spirits.

I didn't know conferences got whiskies. I didn't know that was a thing you could do. File paperwork with the federal government commemorating mid-major basketball. But you can. Apparently. Someone did. The TTB said yes. So there it is.

### X Post 3 (THE CALLBACK THAT MAKES NO SENSE)

Aurelian Reserve. Bespoken Spirits. "50th Anniversary of the Atlantic 10 Conference." December 19th.

Someone at a marketing agency pitched this. "What if we made a whiskey for mid-major basketball fans." Someone else said yes. Then someone at the A-10 said yes. Then the TTB said yes. A lot of yes. Very little why.

Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball. Dayton. VCU. Other schools. And now whiskey. And you know who the real victim is here. Frank Stallone.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE ESCALATING LIST WITH NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT)

My uncle went to Saint Joseph's. The university. Philadelphia. He talked about it constantly. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Barbecues. Fourth of July.

"I went to Saint Joe's," he'd say. "Atlantic 10. Good conference."

Next line.

"I was almost a walk-on," he'd say. "For the basketball team. But my knee. You know."

Next line.

"I still watch every game," he'd say. "Haven't missed one since '74."

Next line.

He missed three. I counted. I don't know why I counted.

Next line.

His wife left him in 1998. His son doesn't talk to him. He lives in Delaware now. Wilmington. Near a mall. The knee is fine, apparently. Always was.

Anyway, there's a whiskey for the Atlantic 10 now. Fiftieth anniversary. Aurelian Reserve. Bespoken Spirits. December 19th. My uncle would have opinions about this. Strong ones. I could call him. I won't.

### LinkedIn Post 2 (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

Conference-branded whisky. This is a category now, apparently.

Bespoken Spirits filed one for the Atlantic 10. Fiftieth anniversary. Aurelian Reserve brand. December 19th.

I looked for other conference whiskies. The SEC. The Big Ten. The ACC. Found nothing. This might be the first one. Or the only one. Or there are others and I didn't look hard enough. All three possible.

Is this a trend. Probably not. Will there be more. Probably not. Does it matter. I don't know. Is it interesting. Somewhat. Will I think about it again after posting this. Unlikely.

Fifty years of Atlantic 10 basketball. Commemorated in whisky form. VCU made the Final Four in 2011. That's the only thing I remember. Now there's whisky. That's the update.

I don't have a take. I don't have analysis. I don't have a conclusion. The filing exists. That's all I can tell you. Make of it what you will. Or don't. Either way.

## HONORABLE MENTIONS

### YAO FAMILY WINES - Yao Ming's Wine Label

**X Post (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)**

Yao Ming has a wine label. The basketball player. Seven foot six. Played for the Rockets. Retired in 2011. Now he makes wine.

That's the path, I guess. Play professional sports. Get famous. Make wine. I didn't play professional sports. I made a database. We all end up somewhere. His somewhere is Napa. My somewhere is this. Looking at filings. Counting things. It's fine. Better than some options. Not as good as Napa. But fine.

**LinkedIn Post (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)**

Yao Ming has a wine label now. Has for years. Yao Family Wines.

He was a great basketball player. Hall of Fame. Eight-time All-Star. Seven foot six. One of the tallest players ever. I didn't know he could farm grapes. I'm kidding. He probably doesn't farm grapes. He probably signs things and other people farm grapes. That's how it works. I assume. I don't know much about wine. Or farming. Or Yao Ming, really. Just that he's tall. And now he has wine.

The TTB filing doesn't tell you who farms the grapes. Just company name, product name, date. That's all any of us get. Him and me. Same database. Same forms. Just different outcomes.

---

### GHOST FACE VODKA - Wu-Tang Themed

**X Post (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)**

Ghost Face Vodka. Wu-Tang themed, presumably. The rapper. Ghostface Killah.

Wu-Tang was big in the 90s. Very big. "C.R.E.A.M." "Protect Ya Neck." Other songs. I was there. I remember some of it.

Now one of them makes vodka. Time passes. People diversify. That's just how it goes. Better than some options. The 90s had ups and downs. The vodka is probably fine. Most vodka is fine. That's the whole point of vodka.

**X Post (THE CALLBACK THAT MAKES NO SENSE)**

Ghost Face Vodka. Wu-Tang affiliated. C.R.E.A.M. Cash Rules Everything Around Me. Including federal label applications. And the TTB. And this database I built.

Diversified revenue streams. Get the money. Dollar dollar bill, y'all. That's what they said. Back in the 90s. Now it's vodka. Smart, probably. Vodka has margins. I assume. I don't know margins.

And you know who the real victim is here. Frank Stallone.

---

### PICKLE SHINE - Pickle-Flavored Moonshine

**X Post (THE REFUSAL TO BE CORRECTED)**

Pickle Shine got approved. Pickle-flavored moonshine. This makes four pickle spirits this month. Different companies. Different states.

Someone said it's actually three. I said I counted four. They said show me. I showed them. They said one of those is pickle brine, not pickle flavor. I said what's the difference. They said there's a difference. I said I don't think so. They said I was wrong. I said well.

The pickle-industrial complex is real. Four or three. Doesn't matter. It's happening.

**X Post (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)**

Someone made pickle-flavored moonshine. Called it Pickle Shine. TTB approved it.

Is that a good name. I don't know. Is pickle moonshine a good product. Also don't know. Would I drink it. No. But I don't drink most things. Just look at the database. And report what's there.

Pickle moonshine is there now. That's the update. That's the whole update. I don't have more. I don't have less. Just pickle moonshine. In a government database. Forever. Make of it what you will. Or don't.

### YEAR OF THE HORSE - Luzhou Laojiao Baijiu

**X Post (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)**

Luzhou Laojiao filed "Year of the Horse" baijiu. The Chinese spirit. Very old distillery. Four hundred years. Or five hundred. Or six hundred. I read different numbers. On different websites. None of them agreed. Probably four hundred. Give or take fifty.

Year of the Horse was 2014. Also 2002. Also 1990. Comes around every twelve years. That's the zodiac. Horses. Snakes. Rats. Other animals. Twelve total. I was born year of the dog. 1982. Or 1970. Or 1958. Depends on how old you think I am. I'm not going to say.

Anyway. Baijiu. Horse. Government paperwork. Building 4. Near the vending machines. Fifty cents. Per Snickers.

**LinkedIn Post (THE SHAGGY DOG)**

Baijiu doesn't get filed with the TTB very often. It's a Chinese spirit. Most of it stays in China. Which makes sense. That's where the market is.

Hold on. I just remembered something.

I tried baijiu once. 2017. At a dinner. Someone poured it. Small glass. Very small. I drank it. It was strong. Very strong. The strongest thing I've ever had. Stronger than the other things. The whiskey things. The vodka things. All of them.

There was a guy at the dinner. Business associate. He said baijiu is an acquired taste. I said I don't think I'll acquire it. He laughed. I wasn't joking. He stopped laughing. The dinner got awkward. I left early. Took a cab. Twelve dollars. Plus tip.

I don't know why I told you that. Something about the filing. Luzhou Laojiao. Year of the Horse. Made me think of that dinner. And the cab. And the twelve dollars.

Anyway. The distillery is four hundred years old. Or five hundred. They've been making baijiu since before we were a country. They're still making it. We're still a country. Both things true. Both things in the database now.
