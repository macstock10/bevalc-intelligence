## 1. ROBNIK STRATEGIES - Straight Bourbon Whisky

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name = 'ROBNIK STRATEGIES'`
**Company:** Sideshow Spirits, Kinkaider Brewing Co., LLC
**Approval Date:** 12/30/2025
**Class:** STRAIGHT BOURBON WHISKY

### LinkedIn Post (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

Someone filed a bourbon called "Robnik Strategies."

I looked at the filing three times. It says bourbon. Straight bourbon whisky. From a company called Sideshow Spirits.

I thought it was a consulting firm. A management consultancy, maybe. Something with a website that says "synergy" too many times. But no. It is whiskey.

I do not know who Robnik is. I do not know what strategies he developed. The TTB approved it December 30th, 2025. Second to last business day of the year.

Someone at the TTB typed "Robnik Strategies" into a database. Then they went home. Did not think about strategy consulting. Did not think about bourbon. Just the usual evening.

## 2. WONKY EAR - American Single Malt Whiskey

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name = 'WONKY EAR'`
**Company:** Sideshow Spirits, Kinkaider Brewing Co., LLC
**Approval Date:** 12/30/2025
**Class:** AMERICAN SINGLE MALT WHISKEY

### LinkedIn Post (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

Sideshow Spirits filed two whiskeys on December 30th, 2025. "Robnik Strategies" and "Wonky Ear."

Same company. Same day. Two whiskeys. One sounds like a consulting firm. One sounds like a medical condition.

I looked up "wonky ear" to see if it meant something. It does not appear to mean anything. Just wonky. Just ear. Together now. On a whiskey label. In a government database. Forever.

The company is operated by Kinkaider Brewing Co. in Nebraska. They also make beer. They apparently also make oddly named whiskeys. Two at a time. On the last Tuesday of December.

## 3. BEARDED HOBO - Ale

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name = 'BEARDED HOBO'`
**Company:** The Bearded Hobo, Sixsons LLC
**Approval Date:** 12/30/2025
**Class:** ALE

### LinkedIn Post (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

There is a company called The Bearded Hobo. They filed a beer called "Bearded Hobo."

I do not know if the company was named after the beer or the beer was named after the company. I do not know if there is an actual bearded hobo involved. The TTB does not provide this level of detail.

What I do know: Someone incorporated a business. They called it The Bearded Hobo. Then they made a beer. They called it Bearded Hobo. They filed federal paperwork. December 30th, 2025. Near the end of the year.

The commitment to the bit is notable. The business and the product. Same name. No ambiguity about what you are getting.

## 4. 2ND AMENDMENT - Ale

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name = '2ND AMENDMENT'`
**Company:** Tridentine Brewing, Tridentine Brewing LLC
**Approval Date:** 12/30/2025
**Class:** ALE

### X Post (THE REFUSAL TO BE CORRECTED)

Tridentine Brewing filed a beer called "2ND AMENDMENT." It is an ale.

Someone said the name is political. I said it could be about any amendment. They said there is only one second amendment. I said that is technically true. They said I knew what they meant. I said I do not speculate about intent. They said I was being difficult. I said well.

The TTB approved it. December 30th, 2025. Tridentine is a term for the traditional Latin Mass. So we have Latin Mass brewing making constitutional amendment beer. I have no further comment.

## 5. JABBERWOCKY DOUBLE INDIA PALE ALE

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name = 'JABBERWOCKY DOUBLE INDIA PALE ALE'`
**Company:** Aldus Brewing Co.
**Approval Date:** 12/31/2025
**Class:** ALE

### LinkedIn Post (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)

Aldus Brewing filed "Jabberwocky Double India Pale Ale" on December 31st, 2025. The last business day of the year.

Lewis Carroll wrote the Jabberwocky poem in 1871. "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves." That sort of thing. Nonsense words. Victorian weirdness. Now it is an IPA.

Someone at the TTB processed this filing on New Year's Eve. Or the day before. The database does not specify the exact time. They typed "Jabberwocky" into a federal system. Then they went home. Attended a party, probably. Did not think about slithy toves.

It is a living. Processing beer names. Some of them make sense. Some of them are from 19th century nonsense poetry.

## 6. 100 VECES / 100 VECESS - Tequila

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name LIKE '100 VECE%'`
**Company:** CRAFT SPIRITS TOP INC
**Approval Date:** 12/31/2025
**Class:** TEQUILA FB

### X Post (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

CRAFT SPIRITS TOP INC filed "100 VECES" tequila on December 31st. They also filed "100 VECESS" tequila on the same day.

One has an extra S. I do not know which one is correct. The TTB approved both. They are now both in the database. Two separate filings. Two separate approvals. For what appears to be the same product with a typo.

I could have caught this. I did not. The TTB could have caught this. They did not. CRAFT SPIRITS TOP INC definitely should have caught this. They did not.

One hundred times. Cien veces. Spelled two ways. Both approved. Both forever. Happy New Year.

## 7. THE 12TH SPICE - Bourbon Whisky

**D1 Verified:** `SELECT * FROM colas WHERE brand_name = 'THE 12TH SPICE'`
**Company:** Jacob Rieger & Company, Jacob Rieger & Company, LLC
**Approval Date:** 12/30/2025
**Class:** BOURBON WHISKY

### LinkedIn Post (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

Jacob Rieger & Company filed a bourbon called "The 12th Spice."

I do not know what the other eleven spices are. I do not know if there is a list. I do not know if the 12th spice is meant to be mysterious or if it follows from some established taxonomy.

Is it a Kentucky Colonel situation. Eleven herbs and spices. The 12th one being bourbon. Maybe. Is it a Dune reference. The spice must flow. Probably not. Is it just a name someone thought sounded interesting. Most likely.

Jacob Rieger has been around since 1887. They stopped during Prohibition. Started again in 2014. Now they are filing spice-numbered bourbon. That is 137 years of history leading to this. Or 11 years, depending on how you count.

I do not have a conclusion. The bourbon exists. It is the 12th spice. Make of it what you will.

## WEEKLY ROUNDUP - Stats Post

### LinkedIn Post (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS + DATA)

14,099 alcohol labels filed with the TTB the last week of 2025. I counted. December 25th through December 31st. The holiday week.

3,411 new brands. 168 first-time filers. Wine dominated, as it does.

Notable filings:
- Accolade Brands led with 173 filings. Wine mostly.
- Someone filed a bourbon called "Robnik Strategies." It is not a consulting firm.
- Sideshow Spirits filed "Wonky Ear" whiskey. I do not know why.
- A tequila was filed twice with a typo. Both approved.

Someone at the TTB processed all 14,099 of these. During the holidays. Between Christmas and New Year's. That is the job. Names into databases. Every day. Even the quiet ones.

Full database at bevalcintel.com. 1.6 million records. All of them real. All of them from D1.
