# Social Media Drafts - January 11, 2026

Week ending January 11, 2026. 21,633 filings. Wine dominated. A brewery made lawyer whiskey. The usual chaos.

**Techniques Applied:**
1. COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL (Building 4, vending machines, fifty cents)
2. THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT (respected brewery, pretentious name)
3. THE ESCALATING LIST WITH NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT (wife left, dog died, sandwich shop)
4. THE REFUSAL TO BE CORRECTED (pickle count, dragon taxonomy)
5. THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE (couldn't pronounce it, gave up)
6. THE CALLBACK THAT MAKES NO SENSE (Frank Stallone)
7. THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS (better than some jobs)
8. THE EMPTY CONCLUSION (I don't have a take)

Zero emojis. Zero exclamation marks.

## 1. ALPHABETA BREWERY - "Association of Corporate Counsel"

**Context:** Whisky - Approved 01/08/2026 - A brewery making whiskey named after a legal trade organization

### X Post 1 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

A brewery called AlphaBeta filed a whiskey called "Association of Corporate Counsel." The TTB approved it January 8th.

I spent twenty minutes trying to figure this out. A brewery. Making whiskey. Named after what appears to be a legal trade organization. I couldn't make sense of it. I stopped trying. The filing exists. That's all I know. That's all I'm going to know.

### X Post 2 (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

The Association of Corporate Counsel is a real organization. Over 45,000 members. They are lawyers. Corporate ones. The counsel kind.

Someone named a whiskey after them. A brewery did this. AlphaBeta Brewery. They make beer, presumably. They filed whiskey. Named it after lawyers.

I'm not saying this is confusing. I'm saying I don't understand it. Those are different things. Similar though.

### X Post 3 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

AlphaBeta Brewery. "Association of Corporate Counsel." Whisky. January 8th, 2026. 3:15 PM. Building 4. Near the vending machines. The ones with the Snickers. Fifty cents. Per bar.

Someone at the TTB typed "Association of Corporate Counsel" into a federal database. Then they typed "AlphaBeta Brewery." Then they looked at the category. Whisky. They probably paused. Checked the application again. Brewery. Whisky. Lawyers.

Approved it anyway. That's the job. Don't ask questions. Type the names. Go home. Watch television.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE ESCALATING LIST WITH NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT)

A guy emailed me once about brand naming. He worked in legal. Corporate counsel, actually. For a beverage company. Fortune 500. Or 1000. One of those numbers.

He said the best brand names were simple. Evocative. Nothing confusing.

Next line.

He also said he was getting divorced.

Next line.

And that his kid wouldn't return his calls. And that he'd moved to a smaller apartment. Near a Walgreens. He bought a lot of things at that Walgreens. Toothpaste, mostly. And antacids.

Next line.

He asked if I knew anyone hiring.

Next line.

I did not.

Anyway, AlphaBeta Brewery filed a whiskey called "Association of Corporate Counsel" this week. A brewery. Making whiskey. Named after lawyers. My correspondent would have had thoughts about this. He's in insurance now. Or accounting. One of those. The apartment is bigger, I think. Near a different Walgreens.

### LinkedIn Post 2 (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

AlphaBeta Brewery filed a whiskey called "Association of Corporate Counsel." January 8th, 2026.

Is this a licensing deal. I don't know. Is it a joke. Maybe. Is it meant to be consumed by lawyers after long meetings about corporate governance. Could be. Is it good whiskey. Can't say. Haven't tried it. Won't.

The Association of Corporate Counsel has over 45,000 members. They handle legal matters for companies. Now there's a whiskey named after them. Made by a brewery.

I don't have analysis. I don't have a theory. I don't have a take. Just a filing. In a database. Make of it what you will. Or don't. Either way.

## 2. TREE HOUSE BREWING COMPANY - 178 Labels in One Week

**Context:** Specialty Beer/Ale - Massachusetts - Most active craft brewery filer

### X Post 1 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

Tree House Brewing filed 178 labels this week. That's one every 45 minutes if you assume eight-hour business days. I assume business days. Tree House is in Massachusetts. Charlton, specifically. Population 13,000. Give or take.

Someone in Charlton filled out 178 TTB applications in one week. Then someone at the TTB approved 178 applications. From Charlton. In one week. That's 356 human interactions about beer labels. In seven days. From a town of 13,000.

I don't know what else to say about this.

### X Post 2 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

I tried to understand Tree House's business model. They don't distribute widely. You have to go there. Or know someone who went there. There's a secondary market. People drive hours.

Somehow this supports 178 label filings in one week.

I tried to make the economics work in my head. Couldn't. I'm bad at economics. I'm bad at most things. Craft beer math is beyond me. They seem to be doing fine.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)

Tree House Brewing Company filed 178 labels with the TTB this week. Second most active filer, behind Adventures in Wine.

They make hazy IPAs. The kind that look like orange juice. Cost fourteen dollars for a four-pack. People say nice things about them on the internet. I've read some of it.

Someone at Tree House filled out 178 applications. Then someone at the TTB processed 178 applications. Then the applications became approvals. Then the approvals became beer.

It's a living. For both of them. The Tree House person and the TTB person. Both doing their jobs. Filling things out. Approving things. Going home. Eating dinner. Coming back. Doing it again.

It's better than some jobs. There are worse things than IPAs. Many worse things. So there's that.

## 3. VICIOUS FISHES BREWERY - Dragon IPAs

**Context:** India Pale Ale - Filed "DOUBLE DRAGONS" and "HERE BE DRAGONS" in the same week

### X Post 1 (THE REFUSAL TO BE CORRECTED)

Vicious Fishes Brewery filed two dragon-themed IPAs this week. "DOUBLE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE" and "HERE BE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE."

Someone said fish and dragons aren't related. I said some cultures have water dragons. They said those aren't fish. I said the company is called Vicious Fishes. They said that doesn't explain the dragons. I said it doesn't not explain them either. They said I was wrong. I said well.

### X Post 2 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

Vicious Fishes Brewery. Two filings. Same week. "DOUBLE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE." "HERE BE DRAGONS INDIA PALE ALE."

Maroni Beverage Company handles their paperwork. Someone at Maroni had to type "DOUBLE DRAGONS" into the TTB system. Then they had to type "HERE BE DRAGONS" into the same system. On the same day, probably. Building 4. Desk 14. Near the vending machines.

They typed "dragons" twice. Into a federal database. Then went home. Ate dinner. Didn't think about dragons. Or fish. Watched television instead.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

I tried to understand the Vicious Fishes brand strategy. They're called Vicious Fishes. They make beers about dragons.

I looked for the connection. Couldn't find it. Fish aren't dragons. Dragons aren't fish. Even the vicious ones.

Maybe there's mythology I'm missing. Sea serpents. Leviathans. The overlap between aquatic creatures and fire-breathing reptiles. I don't know. I didn't study mythology. Or biology. Or marketing.

Two dragon IPAs. From a fish-themed brewery. Filed in the same week. That's the update. The explanation remains unclear.

## 4. BURIAL BEER CO. - "Visuals - Conjured in Shadows"

**Context:** Table Red Wine - Asheville, NC - A brewery filing wine

### X Post 1 (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

Burial Beer Co. is a respected brewery. Asheville, North Carolina. Very creative. Award-winning, probably. People say nice things about them.

They filed a red wine this week. "VISUALS." Fanciful name: "CONJURED IN SHADOWS."

I didn't know breweries made wine now. I didn't know that was a thing you could do. File one category, get approved for another. The TTB doesn't seem to care. Beer company. Wine product. Different things. Same database. All approved.

### X Post 2 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

A brewery called Burial Beer filed a wine called "Conjured in Shadows." I don't know what that means. I don't know what conjured shadows have to do with wine. Or beer. Or Asheville.

I spent ten minutes thinking about it. Gave up. Some things aren't meant to be understood. They're meant to be filed. And approved. And put in a database. That's enough.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)

Burial Beer Co. filed a table red wine this week. The wine is called "VISUALS" with a fanciful name of "CONJURED IN SHADOWS."

This is a brewery. Making wine. With a name that sounds like an art school thesis project.

Someone at Burial filled out the paperwork. Someone at the TTB looked at a wine application from a company with "Beer" in the name. They approved it anyway. Went home. Ate dinner. Didn't think about the convergence of brewing and winemaking.

That's the job. Names into databases. Categories don't matter. Labels get approved. Life continues.

## 5. FOUR LOKO - "STORM"

**Context:** Malt Beverages - Ongoing brand extension strategy

### X Post 1 (THE CALLBACK THAT MAKES NO SENSE)

Four Loko filed "STORM" this week. This is at least the fourteenth new Four Loko filing in six months. They're still at it. Still innovating. Still presumably being consumed at gas stations at 11pm.

I track these things. I don't drink them. I don't know anyone who does. But someone does. Multiple someones. The filings keep coming.

And you know who the real victim is here. Frank Stallone.

### X Post 2 (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

Four Loko filed a new variant called "STORM."

Is this a good product. I don't know. Will people drink it. Probably. Is Four Loko still relevant. The filing activity suggests yes. Is that good or bad. I don't have an opinion.

The brand persists. That's all I can tell you. Fourteen filings in six months. "STORM" is the latest. There will be more. There are always more.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS)

Four Loko filed "STORM" with the TTB this week. The fourteenth new Four Loko product I've tracked in six months.

The brand started in 2005. Originally had caffeine and alcohol together. The FDA had thoughts about that. Changes were made. The brand persisted.

Twenty-one years later, they're still filing. Still innovating. Still putting things in cans with aggressive names. "STORM." Previous ones had different names. All approved. All in the database.

It's a business model. Not the most sophisticated one. But a business model. People buy the products. The products keep coming. That's how commerce works. For Four Loko. For everyone.

## 6. MANDATORY FUN BEER WORKS - "Wild and Crazy"

**Context:** Ale - Arcanum Ventures, LLC

### X Post 1 (THE TURN FROM RESPECT TO INSULT)

There's a brewery called Mandatory Fun Beer Works. This is a real business. That files federal paperwork. Under that name.

They filed a beer called "WILD AND CRAZY."

The juxtaposition is notable. Fun is mandatory. It's required. You will have it. But also wild. Also crazy. Within the mandatory parameters, presumably.

I don't know what's happening in the craft beer industry. I just read the filings. The filings raise questions I can't answer.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (COMMIT TO THE ABSURD DETAIL)

Mandatory Fun Beer Works. Filed under Arcanum Ventures, LLC. Product name: "WILD AND CRAZY."

Arcanum means "secret" or "mystery." So we have a mystery company. Running a mandatory fun brewery. Making wild and crazy beer.

Someone at the TTB looked at this. They saw "Arcanum Ventures." They saw "Mandatory Fun Beer Works." They saw "WILD AND CRAZY." They typed all of it into a database. Building 4. Row C. Near the vending machines. Fifty cents per Snickers.

Approved it. Went home. Ate dinner. Watched television. Didn't think about mandatory fun. Or wild craziness. Or secret ventures. Just the usual evening. The usual life. Names into databases. Every day. Forever.

## 7. TEMPLETON RYE - "Midnight Rye"

**Context:** Whisky Specialties - New expression from established brand

### X Post 1 (THE FLAT ADMISSION OF FAILURE)

Templeton Rye filed "Midnight Rye" this week. I tried to find out what "midnight" means in whiskey terms. Couldn't. Darker? Maybe. Aged differently? Possibly. Just a name? Probably.

I don't understand whiskey nomenclature. "Midnight." "Reserve." "Special." "Small Batch." They all mean something. Or they mean nothing. I can't tell anymore.

### LinkedIn Post 1 (THE EMPTY CONCLUSION)

Templeton Rye Spirits filed "TEMPLETON - MIDNIGHT RYE" this week. New expression. Whisky Specialties category.

Is it good whiskey. I don't know. Is "midnight" a meaningful descriptor. Can't say. Is this part of a broader portfolio strategy. Probably. Does it matter to anyone reading this. Unlikely.

Templeton has been around since 2006. Or earlier, depending on how you count. They file labels. The labels get approved. The whiskey gets made. People drink it. The cycle continues.

I don't have analysis. Just a filing. "Midnight." Whatever that means.

## WEEKLY ROUNDUP - Stats Post

### LinkedIn Post (THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF DARKNESS + DATA)

21,633 alcohol labels filed with the TTB last week. I counted. I count most things now.

5,615 new brands. 787 first-time filers. Wine dominated at 63%. Beer held steady. Spirits did their thing.

Notable filings:
- AlphaBeta Brewery filed a whiskey called "Association of Corporate Counsel." A brewery. Making whiskey. For lawyers.
- Tree House filed 178 labels. One every 45 minutes if you assume business hours. I assume business hours.
- Four Loko filed "STORM." They're still at it. The brand persists.

Someone at the TTB processed all 21,633 of these. One at a time. Into a database. Then they went home. Ate dinner. Watched television. Came back. Did it again. That's the job.

Full database at bevalcintel.com. We track all of it. We don't know why anymore. We just do.
