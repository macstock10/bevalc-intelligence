## Post 1: Weekly Intelligence Brief
**Schedule:** Monday 9am ET

2,698 alcohol labels filed with TTB in the first week of January 2026.

That is 15% below the same period last year (3,190 filings in Jan 2-10, 2025).

**The Numbers**
- Total filings: 2,698
- New brands: 550
- New SKUs: 1,226
- New companies: 61

**Top Filers**
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 39 filings
2. Vintage Collectibles - 29 filings
3. MISA Imports - 22 filings
4. Fort George Brewery - 19 filings
5. Everywhere Beer Co. - 19 filings

**What This Signals**

The 15% year-over-year decline reflects the typical post-holiday slowdown, but the 61 new company filings suggest new market entrants are not pulling back. New companies represent 2% of total filings - consistent with historical patterns.

Wine continues to dominate early-year filings at 49% of total volume, with importers positioning inventory for spring allocations. The top three filers are all wine importers, which aligns with the Q1 pattern of locking in distributor portfolios before March deadlines.

Craft beer activity remains steady with Fort George and Everywhere Beer both at 19 filings each. This early-year positioning typically signals spring seasonal releases hitting shelves by April.

## Post 2: Category Analysis (Whiskey)
**Schedule:** Wednesday 10am ET

223 whiskey labels filed with TTB in the first week of January.

That is 8% of all filings this month.

**Category Breakdown**
- Straight Bourbon: 56 filings
- Whisky Specialties: 34 filings
- Bourbon Whisky: 27 filings
- Single Malt Scotch: 19 filings
- Straight Rye: 16 filings
- Other Whiskey: 71 filings

**What This Signals**

The 8% whiskey share is below the category's typical 12-15% annual average, reflecting seasonal patterns. Whiskey filings traditionally accelerate in Q2 as producers position for fall releases and holiday inventory builds.

The whiskey category is notably fragmented this month with no single dominant filer - a departure from 2025 when Brown-Forman and Sazerac regularly topped the list. This suggests smaller craft distillers are driving early-year activity.

Watch American Single Malt (6 filings) - this emerging category continues to gain traction as craft distillers differentiate from traditional bourbon.

## Post 3: Market Movers
**Schedule:** Thursday 10am ET

61 new companies filed their first TTB labels in the first week of January 2026.

These first-time filers account for 2% of total volume - a leading indicator of market entry momentum.

**Signal Breakdown**
- New companies: 61 filings (2%)
- New brands: 550 filings (20%)
- New SKUs: 1,226 filings (45%)
- Refiles: 861 filings (32%)

**What This Signals**

The 550 new brand filings represent 20% of total volume - a healthy indicator that established companies continue expanding portfolios despite broader industry caution.

The ratio of new SKUs (45%) to refiles (32%) suggests genuine product innovation rather than administrative maintenance. When refiles dominate, it signals portfolio consolidation. The current mix points to growth-oriented activity.

New company filings are the canary in the coal mine for market confidence. At 61, January is tracking to historical norms. A drop below 50 would signal tightening conditions.

## Post 4: Intent Signals
**Schedule:** Friday 10am ET

Wine importers are dominating early January filings with 49% category share.

The top 3 filers are all wine-focused:
1. Connoisseur Wines USA - 39 filings
2. Vintage Collectibles - 29 filings
3. MISA Imports - 22 filings

**Why January Wine Surge Matters**

Filing now means bottles on shelves by April. Wine importers are front-loading Q1 to lock in spring allocations before distributors finalize portfolios in March.

The 1,325 wine filings break down as:
- Table Red: 446 (34%)
- Table White: 415 (31%)
- Dessert/Port/Sherry: 239 (18%)
- Sparkling: 120 (9%)
- Rose: 71 (5%)

The strong dessert wine showing (18% of wine filings vs. typical 10-12%) suggests positioning for Valentine's Day and spring dessert wine programs.

Watch Connoisseur Wines USA - at 39 filings they are running at elevated velocity. Portfolio expansion or distributor mandate filling.
