    "21,633 alcohol labels were filed with the TTB last week. 5,615 were new brands. 787 were from companies filing for the first time ever.\n\nSomeone at a company called AlphaBeta Brewery filed a whiskey called \"Association of Corporate Counsel.\" It was approved on January 8th. I do not know why a brewery is making whiskey. I do not know why they named it after what appears to be a legal trade organization.\n\nThese are the things that happen in the TTB database. We track them.",

    "Tree House Brewing Company filed 178 labels in one week. That is more than one per hour if you assume eight-hour days.\n\nThey make hazy IPAs. People drive to Massachusetts to buy them. The company does not distribute widely. You have to go there or know someone who went there.\n\nSomehow this business model supports filing 178 labels in seven days. I do not fully understand craft beer economics.",

    "A brewery in Asheville called Burial Beer Co. filed a red wine this week. The wine is called \"VISUALS\" with a fanciful name of \"CONJURED IN SHADOWS.\"\n\nI do not know when breweries started making wine. The TTB approved it. It is in the database now. A beer company making wine. The categories blur.",

    "Four Loko filed a new variant called \"STORM\" this week. This is at least the fourteenth new Four Loko filing in the past six months.\n\nThe brand persists. They are still innovating. Someone is still drinking Four Loko. Multiple someones, presumably, given the ongoing filing activity.\n\nI track these things. I do not judge them."
